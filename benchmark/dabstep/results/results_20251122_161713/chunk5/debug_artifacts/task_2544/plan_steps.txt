Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file into a dataframe and filter for rows where the `merchant` column is 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' and the `year` column is 2023.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the original `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, and `capture_delay` for "Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse", load `fees.json`, and calculate the monthly total volume and monthly fraud rate (fraud volume / total volume) for the merchant in 2023 using the filtered payments data.
Step 3: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`. Filter payments for 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' in 2023. Retrieve the merchant's original MCC, account type, and capture delay. Calculate monthly total volume and fraud rates. Then, iterate through the transactions to calculate the total fees twice: once using the original MCC and once using the hypothetical MCC (5411), by matching each transaction against the rules in `fees.json` (considering all criteria including monthly stats, intracountry status, etc.). Finally, calculate and print the difference (New Fees - Original Fees).
