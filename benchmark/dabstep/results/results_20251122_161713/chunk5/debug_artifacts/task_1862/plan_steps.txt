Step 1: Filter the `payments.csv` dataset to include only transactions where the `merchant` is 'Rafa_AI' and the `day_of_year` is between 91 and 120 (inclusive), which corresponds to April 2023.
Step 2: Calculate the total fraud volume for the filtered transactions (where `has_fraudulent_dispute` is True) to determine the fraud rate (Fraud Volume / Total Volume), and load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the `account_type`, `merchant_category_code`, and `capture_delay` for 'Rafa_AI'.
Step 3: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`. Filter for 'Rafa_AI' transactions in April (days 91-120). Calculate the total transaction volume and fraud rate for this period. Retrieve 'Rafa_AI's account details. Then, for each transaction, identify the applicable fee rule from `fees.json` based on transaction attributes (scheme, credit, ACI, intracountry) and merchant stats (volume, fraud rate, account type, MCC, capture delay), calculate the fee, and sum the total fees.
