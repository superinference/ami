Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file into a dataframe and filter it to include only the rows where the `merchant` column is 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' and the `year` column is 2023.
Step 2: Load the `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json` files. Filter the payments data for the merchant 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' and the year 2023. Retrieve the merchant's `account_type` and original `merchant_category_code` from `merchant_data.json`. Then, for each transaction, determine the applicable fee rule from `fees.json` (matching on card scheme, account type, ACI, is_credit, intracountry status, and MCC) to calculate the total fees twice: once using the original MCC and once using the hypothetical MCC 8062. Finally, calculate the difference between the new total fees and the original total fees.
