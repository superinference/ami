Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the dataframe to include only transactions where the `merchant` is 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso', the `year` is 2023, and the `day_of_year` is between 1 and 31 (representing January).
Step 2: Load the filtered transactions from the pickle file, load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the merchant's specific attributes (account type, category code, capture delay), and calculate the total monthly volume and fraud rate (fraudulent volume / total volume) for January 2023 to determine the applicable volume and fraud level buckets for fee calculation.
