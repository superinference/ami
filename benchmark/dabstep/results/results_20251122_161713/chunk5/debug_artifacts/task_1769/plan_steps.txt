Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` dataset and filter for transactions where `merchant` is 'Crossfit_Hanna', `year` is 2023, and `day_of_year` is between 182 and 212 (inclusive) to isolate the relevant data for July 2023.
Step 2: Based on the obtained results which have already calculated the monthly volume (€428,299.93), fraud ratio (9.49%), and identified the applicable fee IDs by matching transaction profiles against the fee rules, the next step is to compile and present this final list.

Output the final list of applicable Fee IDs for Crossfit_Hanna in July 2023, which are: 29, 36, 51, 64, 65, 89, 107, 123, 150, 163, 276, 304, 381, 384, 428, 454, 473, 477, 536, 572, 595, 626, 631, 678, 680, 704, 709, 741, 792, 813, 861, 871, 884.
