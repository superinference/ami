Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter for transactions where the merchant is 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' and the month is June (month 6), then calculate the total monthly volume, average transaction amount, and the count of transactions to establish the merchant's transaction profile for that month.
Step 2: Load `payments.csv` to calculate the fraud volume and resulting fraud rate for 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' in June (days 152-181), then load `fees.json` and `merchant_data.json` to calculate the projected total fees for each card scheme (NexPay, GlobalCard, SwiftCharge, TransactPlus) by applying the fee rules matching the merchant's profile (MCC 5812, Account Type H, Capture Delay immediate, Volume ~100k, calculated Fraud Rate) to the merchant's June transaction mix (Credit/Debit, Intra/Inter, ACI counts).
