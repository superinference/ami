Step 1: Filter the `payments.csv` dataset to include only rows where `merchant` is 'Belles_cookbook_store', `has_fraudulent_dispute` is True, and the transaction date falls within July (using `day_of_year` or by converting to datetime).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to get the merchant category code and account type for 'Belles_cookbook_store', and load `fees.json`. Then, using the filtered fraudulent transactions from the previous step, calculate the total estimated fees for each possible Authorization Characteristics Indicator (ACI) by applying the relevant fee rules (matching on card scheme, account type, mcc, is_credit, and intracountry status), and identify the ACI that yields the lowest total fees.
