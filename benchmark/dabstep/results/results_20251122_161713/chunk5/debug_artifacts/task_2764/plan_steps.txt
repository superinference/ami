Step 1: Load `payments.csv` and filter for transactions where `merchant` is 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' and `year` is 2023, then calculate the merchant's transaction profile (total monthly volume, monthly fraud rate, average transaction amount) and retrieve their metadata (MCC, account type) from `merchant_data.json`.
Step 2: Load `fees.json` and filter for rules applicable to 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' based on its metadata (MCC 5812, Account Type 'H', Capture Delay 'immediate', Monthly Volume '100k-1m', Monthly Fraud Level '>8.3%'), then calculate the weighted average fee per transaction for each card scheme using the merchant's transaction profile (73.12% credit, 9.98% intracountry, €91.29 average amount, and the specific ACI distribution).
