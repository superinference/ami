Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the dataframe to include only transactions where the `merchant` is 'Belles_cookbook_store' and the `day_of_year` is between 60 and 90 (representing March 2023).
Step 2: Load `fees.json` and `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the details for fee ID=384 and the profile for 'Belles_cookbook_store', then filter the previously identified March 2023 transactions to find those matching the fee rule's criteria (considering card scheme, ACI, account type, MCC, and intracountry status), and finally calculate the payment delta using the formula `(99 - original_rate) * matching_transaction_volume / 10000`.
