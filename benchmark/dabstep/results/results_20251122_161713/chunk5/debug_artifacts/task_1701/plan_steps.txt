Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only rows where the `merchant` is 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse', the `year` is 2023, and the `day_of_year` is 100.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the `account_type`, `merchant_category_code`, and `capture_delay` for 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse'. Then, load `payments.csv` to calculate the merchant's total transaction volume and fraud rate for April 2023 (days 91-120), and finally, load `fees.json` to identify which Fee IDs apply to the transactions from day 100 based on the merchant's attributes, monthly stats, and transaction details (scheme, credit status, ACI, intracountry status).
