Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file and filter for the entry with `ID` equal to 17 to retrieve its current configuration (specifically `card_scheme`, `account_type`, and other applicability rules).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` and `payments.csv`, then filter for merchants that satisfy Fee 17's original criteria (capture_delay > 5, card_scheme='SwiftCharge', is_credit=True, aci='A') and display their names along with their 'account_type' to determine who is affected by the restriction to account type 'S'.
Step 3: Load `merchant_data.json` and `payments.csv`, filter `merchant_data` for merchants with `capture_delay` values representing more than 5 days (e.g., '7'), filter `payments` for transactions with `card_scheme`='SwiftCharge', `is_credit`=True, and `aci`='A', find the intersection of merchants satisfying both, and finally identify which of these do not have `account_type` 'S'.
