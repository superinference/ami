Step 2: Based on the provided results from the previous execution, the relevant data has already been extracted and processed.
- The fee with ID=398 was identified, with an old rate of 99 and a new rate of 1.
- The volume of transactions matching this fee's criteria for `Belles_cookbook_store` in January 2023 was found to be 613.0 EUR (across 7 transactions).
- The delta has been calculated as `(1 - 99) / 10000 * 613.0 = -6.0074`.
