Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter for transactions where the merchant is 'Rafa_AI' and the year is 2023 to calculate the merchant's total monthly volume and fraud rate, which are necessary to match the correct fee rules.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, and `capture_delay` for 'Rafa_AI', calculate the merchant's average monthly volume, fraud rate, and average transaction value from `payments.csv` for 2023, and then query `fees.json` to find the applicable fee rules for each card scheme to determine which one results in the highest fee per transaction.
