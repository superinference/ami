Step 1: Load `payments.csv` and filter for transactions where `merchant` is 'Belles_cookbook_store' and `day_of_year` is between 274 and 304 (representing October 2023).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` and `fees.json` to retrieve the attributes for 'Belles_cookbook_store' and the specific criteria for fee ID 398. Then, using the previously filtered October 2023 transactions for this merchant, identify which transactions match the criteria for fee ID 398 (matching card scheme, credit status, ACI, intracountry status, account type, and MCC). Finally, calculate the total volume of these matching transactions and compute the fee difference using the formula: `total_volume * (99 - original_rate) / 10000`.
