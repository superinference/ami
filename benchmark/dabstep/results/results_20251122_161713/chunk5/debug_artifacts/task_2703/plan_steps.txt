Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter for transactions where the `merchant` is 'Crossfit_Hanna', `has_fraudulent_dispute` is True, and `day_of_year` is between 32 and 59 (representing February).
Step 2: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`. Filter `payments.csv` for 'Crossfit_Hanna' in February (day_of_year 32-59) to calculate the total monthly volume and fraud rate (Fraud Volume / Total Volume), and for the fraudulent transactions specifically, aggregate the count and sum of `eur_amount` grouped by `card_scheme` and `intracountry` status (issuing_country == acquirer_country). Also, retrieve the merchant's `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, and `capture_delay`.
Step 3: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json` to calculate the total fees for Crossfit_Hanna's fraudulent transactions in February (day_of_year 32-59) under each alternative Authorization Characteristics Indicator (A, B, C, D, E, F), considering the merchant's specific attributes (MCC, account type, capture delay), monthly volume, and fraud level, to determine which ACI results in the lowest cost.
