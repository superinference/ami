Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions for the merchant 'Belles_cookbook_store' that occurred in November (where `day_of_year` is between 305 and 334).
Step 2: Load `fees.json`, `merchant_data.json`, and `payments.csv`. Filter payments for 'Belles_cookbook_store' in November (day_of_year 305-334). Use the merchant's attributes (MCC, Account Type, Capture Delay) and November stats (Volume ~100.6k, Fraud Rate ~9.2%) to select applicable fee rules. Then, for each card scheme, calculate the total hypothetical fees for the November transactions and identify the scheme with the minimum cost.
Step 3: To answer the question about which card scheme Belles_cookbook_store should steer traffic to for minimum fees, I need to calculate the hypothetical total fees for the merchant's November transactions under each of the four card schemes, based on the merchant's specific profile and the fee rules.

Here is the plan:
1. Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, `fees.json`, and `acquirer_countries.csv`.
2. Filter `payments.csv` for the merchant 'Belles_cookbook_store' and the month of November (day_of_year 305 to 334).
3. Retrieve the merchant's attributes from `merchant_data.json` (MCC, Account Type, Capture Delay, Acquirer) and determine the Acquirer Country using `acquirer_countries.csv`.
4. Calculate the merchant's November statistics: Total Volume and Fraud Rate (Fraud Volume / Total Volume).
5. Define a function to calculate the fee for a single transaction under a specific card scheme by finding the matching rule in `fees.json` (matching on MCC, Account Type, Capture Delay, Volume, Fraud Level
