Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions for the merchant 'Crossfit_Hanna' that occurred in December 2023 (where `day_of_year` is greater than or equal to 335).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to get the merchant's attributes (account type, category code, capture delay) and `fees.json` for the fee rules. Then, using the filtered payments data, calculate the total fraud volume (sum of `eur_amount` where `has_fraudulent_dispute` is True) to determine the fraud rate percentage and identify the correct `monthly_volume` and `monthly_fraud_level` buckets for December 2023.
Step 3: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`. Filter payments for 'Crossfit_Hanna' in December 2023 (day_of_year >= 335). Calculate the total monthly volume and fraud rate to determine the applicable `monthly_volume` and `monthly_fraud_level` buckets. Then, for each transaction, find the matching fee rule from `fees.json` (matching on card_scheme, account_type, mcc, capture_delay, is_credit, aci, intracountry, and the calculated buckets) and calculate the fee using the formula `fixed_amount + (rate * eur_amount / 10000)`, finally summing all fees to get the total.
