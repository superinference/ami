Step 1: Load the `merchant_category_codes.csv` file and filter the rows where the `description` column exactly matches "Drinking Places (Alcoholic Beverages) - Bars, Taverns, Nightclubs, Cocktail Lounges, and Discotheques" to retrieve the corresponding Merchant Category Code (MCC).
Step 2: Load the `fees.json` file and filter for rules where `card_scheme` is 'NexPay', `account_type` is either null, empty, or contains 'H', and `merchant_category_code` is either null, empty, or contains 5813. For each matching rule, calculate the fee using the formula `fixed_amount + (rate * 5000 / 10000)`, then compute the average of these fees.
Step 3: The previous calculation appears to be correct and based on the proper filtering criteria (MCC 5813, Account Type 'H', Card Scheme 'NexPay') and formula (`fixed_amount + rate * 5000 / 10000`). The result `28.495455` is already in the correct magnitude and format.

Output the final answer as 28.495455 EUR.
