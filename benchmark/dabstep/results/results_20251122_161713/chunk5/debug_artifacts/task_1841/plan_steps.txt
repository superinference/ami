Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file into a pandas DataFrame and filter the data to include only transactions where the `merchant` is 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' and the date corresponds to July 2023 (using the `year` and `day_of_year` columns).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` and `fees.json`. Calculate the `monthly_volume` (sum of `eur_amount`) and `monthly_fraud_level` (sum of `eur_amount` for fraudulent transactions divided by total volume) for 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' in July 2023. Then, retrieve the merchant's static attributes (`account_type`, `merchant_category_code`, `capture_delay`) from `merchant_data.json`, determine the `intracountry` status for each transaction, and iterate through the transactions to match them with the correct rule in `fees.json` to calculate the total fees.
Step 3: Output the final answer: 820.30 euros.
