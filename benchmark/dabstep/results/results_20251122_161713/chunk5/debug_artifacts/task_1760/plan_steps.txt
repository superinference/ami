Step 1: To answer the question about applicable Fee IDs for "Belles_cookbook_store" in October 2023, we need to calculate the merchant's volume and fraud metrics for that month, determine their static attributes, and then match these against the rules in `fees.json`.

I will write a Python script to:
1.  **Calculate Merchant Metrics**: Filter `payments.csv` for "Belles_cookbook_store" in October 2023 (days 274-304), calculating total volume and fraud rate.
2.  **Get Merchant Attributes**: Retrieve `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, and `capture_delay` from `merchant_data.json`.
3.  **Parse Fee Rules**: Load `fees.json` and implement robust parsing for fields like `monthly_volume` (e.g., "100k-1m"), `monthly_fraud_level` (e.g., ">8.3%"), and `capture_delay`.
4.  **Match Rules**: Filter fee rules based on the merchant's metrics and attributes, and then check which of the remaining rules apply to the specific transactions (based on `card_scheme`, `aci`, `is_credit`, and `intracountry` status) found in the payments data.
