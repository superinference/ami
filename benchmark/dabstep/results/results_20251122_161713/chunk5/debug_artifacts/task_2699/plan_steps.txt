Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter for transactions where the `merchant` is 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso', the `day_of_year` is between 1 and 31 (representing January), and `has_fraudulent_dispute` is True.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the merchant's attributes (MCC, Account Type), and calculate the total monthly volume and fraud level for 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' in January from `payments.csv` to determine applicable fee tiers. Then, using `fees.json`, calculate and compare the total fees for the previously filtered fraudulent transactions under each alternative Authorization Characteristics Indicator (ACI) to identify the lowest cost option.
