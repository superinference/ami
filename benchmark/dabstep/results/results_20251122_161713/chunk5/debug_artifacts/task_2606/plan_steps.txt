Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions where the `merchant` is 'Rafa_AI' and the `day_of_year` is between 60 and 90 (inclusive), representing the month of March.
Step 2: Load the `merchant_data.json` file to retrieve the `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, and `capture_delay` for 'Rafa_AI', and simultaneously load the `rafa_ai_march_payments.csv` file to calculate the merchant's total monthly volume and fraud rate (total fraudulent amount / total amount) for March.
Step 3: Load the `fees.json` file and use the calculated March metrics (total volume, fraud rate) and transaction profile (average amount, credit ratio, ACI distribution) for 'Rafa_AI' to apply the fee rules for each card scheme ('NexPay', 'GlobalCard', 'SwiftCharge', 'TransactPlus') and identify the scheme that results in the minimum total fees.
