Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions for the merchant 'Belles_cookbook_store' that occurred during the month of February (day_of_year between 32 and 59).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` and `fees.json`. Calculate the February total volume and fraud rate for `Belles_cookbook_store` using the filtered payments data. Group the transactions by `is_credit`, `aci`, and `intracountry` status (where `issuing_country` equals `acquirer_country`). Then, for each card scheme (`NexPay`, `GlobalCard`, `SwiftCharge`, `TransactPlus`), apply the matching fee rules to these groups to calculate the total projected fees and identify the scheme with the maximum fees.
