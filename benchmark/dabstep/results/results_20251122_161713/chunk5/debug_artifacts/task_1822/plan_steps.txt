Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions for the merchant 'Belles_cookbook_store' that occurred in December 2023 (where `day_of_year` is greater than or equal to 335).
Step 2: Load `payments.csv`, `fees.json`, and `merchant_data.json`. Filter payments for 'Belles_cookbook_store' in December 2023 (day_of_year >= 335). Calculate the merchant's monthly volume and fraud rate for December. Then, iterate through each transaction to calculate the applicable fee by matching against `fees.json` rules, ensuring correct handling of range comparisons for `monthly_volume` and `monthly_fraud_level`, mapping `capture_delay` values (e.g., '1' falls under '<3'), and checking `intracountry` status (issuing_country == acquirer_country). Sum the calculated fees to get the total.
