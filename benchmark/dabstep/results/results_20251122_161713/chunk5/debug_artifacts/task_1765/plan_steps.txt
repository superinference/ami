Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the DataFrame to include only transactions where the `merchant` is "Crossfit_Hanna", the `year` is 2023, and the `day_of_year` is between 60 and 90 (representing March).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, and `capture_delay` for 'Crossfit_Hanna'. Then, using the filtered March 2023 payments data, calculate the total transaction volume and fraud rate (fraud amount / total amount), and identify unique transaction profiles based on `card_scheme`, `is_credit`, `aci`, and `intracountry` status (where `intracountry` is True if `issuing_country` matches `acquirer_country`). Finally, load `fees.json` to prepare for rule matching.
