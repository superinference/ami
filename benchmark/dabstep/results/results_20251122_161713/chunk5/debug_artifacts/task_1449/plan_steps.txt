Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file into a dataframe to inspect the fee rules, specifically filtering for entries where `card_scheme` is 'SwiftCharge' and `is_credit` is either True or null.
Step 2: Load `fees.json` into a dataframe, filter for rows where `card_scheme` is 'SwiftCharge' and `is_credit` is either True or null, explode the `aci` column (filling nulls/empty lists with all possible ACIs: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']), calculate the fee for a 10 euro transaction using the formula `fee = fixed_amount + rate * 10 / 10000`, and finally identify the ACI with the highest calculated fee, resolving ties by alphabetical order.
