Step 1: Load the `payments.csv`, `fees.json`, and `merchant_data.json` files, and filter the `payments.csv` dataset to include only transactions where the `merchant` is 'Rafa_AI' and the date falls within October 2023 (specifically, `year` is 2023 and `day_of_year` is between 274 and 304).
Step 2: Load `payments.csv`, `fees.json`, and `merchant_data.json`. Filter `payments` for merchant 'Rafa_AI' in October 2023 (days 274-304). Calculate the merchant's total monthly volume and fraud rate for October. Then, for each transaction, determine the applicable fee rule by iterating through `fees.json` in order and matching all criteria (card scheme, account type, MCC, ACI, is_credit, capture delay, intracountry, monthly volume, and fraud level), treating nulls as wildcards. Identify transactions where the applicable rule ID is 384. For these transactions, calculate the total delta using the formula: sum((1 - original_rate) * eur_amount / 10000).
