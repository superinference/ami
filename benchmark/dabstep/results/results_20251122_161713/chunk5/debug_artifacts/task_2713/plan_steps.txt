Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter for transactions where the merchant is 'Crossfit_Hanna', the `day_of_year` is between 91 and 120 (representing April), and `has_fraudulent_dispute` is True.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the account type and merchant category code for 'Crossfit_Hanna', and load `fees.json`. Then, using the filtered fraudulent transactions from the previous step, calculate the total fees for each possible Authorization Characteristics Indicator (ACI) ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'] by matching the transaction details (card scheme, is_credit, intracountry status) and merchant details against the fee rules, and identify the ACI with the lowest total cost.
Step 3: To answer the question about the preferred Authorization Characteristics Indicator (ACI) for minimizing fees on fraudulent transactions for Crossfit_Hanna in April, I need to calculate and compare the potential fees for each ACI type.

Here is the next plan:
Calculate the total projected fees for Crossfit_Hanna's fraudulent transactions in April (day_of_year 91-120) under each possible ACI (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) by matching each transaction to the applicable rule in `fees.json` (considering the merchant's `account_type`, `merchant_category_code`, `capture_delay` from `merchant_data.json`, and the calculated monthly volume and fraud level for April) and identify the ACI that results in the lowest total fee.
