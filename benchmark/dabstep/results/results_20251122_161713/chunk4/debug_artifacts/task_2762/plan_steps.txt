Step 1: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, `acquirer`, and `capture_delay` for 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso', and then load `payments.csv` to calculate the merchant's 2023 `monthly_volume`, `monthly_fraud_level`, and average `eur_amount`.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, and `capture_delay` for 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso'. Then, load `payments.csv` to calculate the merchant's 2023 `monthly_volume` (total amount), `monthly_fraud_level` (fraud amount / total amount), and average `eur_amount`. Finally, load `fees.json` and iterate through all rules to find the applicable fee for each `card_scheme` by matching the merchant's profile (MCC, account type, volume, fraud rate, capture delay) against the rule criteria (handling nulls as wildcards and parsing ranges), calculate the estimated fee per transaction, and identify the scheme with the lowest cost.
