Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file into a dataframe to access the fee rules, specifically the `card_scheme`, `fixed_amount`, and `rate` columns.
Step 2: Calculate the fee for a transaction value of 1234 EUR for each row in the `fees` dataframe using the formula `fee = fixed_amount + (rate * 1234 / 10000)`, then group by `card_scheme` to calculate the average fee for each scheme and identify the one with the highest average cost.
