Step 1: Load the "fees.json" file into a dataframe and filter for rows where 'card_scheme' is 'SwiftCharge' and 'is_credit' is either True or null (wildcard), then display the first 5 rows to inspect the relevant fee rules.
Step 2: Load "fees.json" into a dataframe, filter for rows where 'card_scheme' is 'SwiftCharge' and 'is_credit' is either True or null, calculate the fee for each rule using the formula `fee = fixed_amount + (rate * 1 / 10000)`, explode the 'aci' column (filling nulls with all possible ACIs ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']), find the maximum fee, and identify the ACI(s) associated with this maximum fee, sorting alphabetically to handle ties.
