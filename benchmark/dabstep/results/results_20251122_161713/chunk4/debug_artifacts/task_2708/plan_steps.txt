Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter for transactions where the merchant is 'Crossfit_Hanna', the `day_of_year` is between 60 and 90 (representing March), and `has_fraudulent_dispute` is True.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` and `fees.json`, then using the `payments.csv` data for 'Crossfit_Hanna' in March (days 60-90), calculate the merchant's total monthly volume and fraud rate to determine the applicable fee tiers; finally, for the fraudulent transactions in that period, calculate the total projected fees for every possible Authorization Characteristics Indicator (ACI) to identify the lowest cost option.
