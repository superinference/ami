Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the DataFrame to include only rows where the `merchant` column is 'Rafa_AI', the `year` is 2023, and the `day_of_year` is less than or equal to 31 (representing January).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the account type, merchant category code, and capture delay for 'Rafa_AI', calculate the total monthly volume and fraud rate from the filtered payments data, load `fees.json`, and then identify the applicable Fee IDs by matching the merchant's attributes, calculated monthly metrics, and transaction characteristics (card scheme, credit status, ACI, intracountry status) against the fee rules.
Step 3: Output the final answer: The applicable Fee IDs for Rafa_AI in January 2023 are 17, 36, 51, 65, 78, 89, 107, 123, 141, 150, 163, 183, 276, 286, 304, 359, 384, 427, 428, 454, 477, 498, 500, 551, 595, 626, 631, 634, 701, 709, 741, 787, 792, 804, 813, 846, 861, 870, 888, 892, 914, 915, 924, and 996.
