Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter for transactions where the merchant is 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse', the month is September (day_of_year between 244 and 273), and `has_fraudulent_dispute` is True.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` and `fees.json` to retrieve merchant attributes and fee rules. Calculate the total monthly volume and fraud rate for 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' in September from `payments.csv` to determine the applicable fee buckets. Then, for the previously filtered fraudulent transactions, calculate the hypothetical total fees for each possible Authorization Characteristics Indicator (ACI) (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) by matching the transactions against the fee rules, and identify the ACI that yields the lowest cost.
