Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions for the merchant "Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse" that occurred in September 2023 (where `year` is 2023 and `day_of_year` is between 244 and 273).
Step 2: Load `fees.json`, `merchant_data.json`, and `payments.csv`. Filter `payments.csv` for "Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse" in September 2023 (Day of Year 244-273). Calculate the merchant's September monthly volume and fraud rate. Extract Rule 16 from `fees.json`. Identify transactions that match Rule 16's criteria (including card scheme, account type, MCC, ACI, is_credit, intracountry status, and the calculated monthly stats). For matching transactions, calculate the total fee delta using the formula: `(99 - original_rate) * eur_amount / 10000`.
