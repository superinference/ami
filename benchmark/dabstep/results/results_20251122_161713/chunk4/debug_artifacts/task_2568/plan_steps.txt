Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file and filter for the entry where `ID` is 17 to inspect its current matching criteria (such as `card_scheme`, `merchant_category_code`, `aci`, etc.) and its current `account_type` setting.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` and filter for merchants where `capture_delay` represents a duration greater than 5 days (e.g., "7") and `account_type` is not "F", then load `payments.csv` and filter for transactions from these merchants that match Fee 17's criteria (`card_scheme` == "SwiftCharge", `is_credit` == True, `aci` == "A") to identify the affected merchants.
