Step 1: Load the `payments.csv`, `fees.json`, `merchant_data.json`, and `acquirer_countries.csv` files into pandas DataFrames to access the transaction data, fee structures, merchant details, and acquirer location information.
Step 2: Based on the obtained result of `-10499.54789399998663`, the calculation for the delta has already been performed. The negative value indicates a reduction in fees, which is consistent with the rate changing to a lower value (1). The next step is to format this result and present it as the final answer.

Output the calculated delta of -10499.55 as the final answer.
