Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file into a dataframe and filter for rows where the `merchant` column is 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso', the `year` column is 2023, and the `day_of_year` column is 12.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the attributes for 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' and `fees.json` for the fee rules. Then, using the full `payments.csv`, calculate the merchant's total monthly volume and fraud rate for January 2023 (since day 12 falls in January) to determine the applicable fee tier. Finally, apply the matching fee rules to the transactions from day 12 to calculate the total fees.
