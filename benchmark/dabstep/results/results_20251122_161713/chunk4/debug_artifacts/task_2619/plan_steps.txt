Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the dataframe to include only transactions where the `merchant` is 'Crossfit_Hanna' and the `day_of_year` is between 121 and 151 (representing the month of May).
Step 2: Load the `merchant_data.json` and `fees.json` files, then calculate the total monthly volume and fraud rate for 'Crossfit_Hanna' in May using the filtered payments data to determine the applicable fee tier parameters.
Step 3: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`, filter for 'Crossfit_Hanna' transactions in May (days 121-151), calculate the monthly volume and fraud rate to identify the correct fee tier, and then compute the total hypothetical fees for these transactions under each card scheme to determine which one maximizes the fees.
