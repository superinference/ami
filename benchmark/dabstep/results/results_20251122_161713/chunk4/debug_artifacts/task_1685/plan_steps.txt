Step 1: Load `payments.csv` into a dataframe and filter the rows where `merchant` is 'Belles_cookbook_store', `day_of_year` is 300, and `year` is 2023.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the account type, merchant category code, and capture delay for 'Belles_cookbook_store'. Then, using `payments.csv`, calculate the merchant's total monthly volume and fraud rate for October 2023 (the month containing day 300). Finally, load `fees.json` and determine the applicable Fee IDs for the transactions on day 300 by matching the transaction attributes (from the filtered data) and merchant profile against the fee rules.
