Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file into a DataFrame to access the fee rules, specifically the `rate`, `fixed_amount`, and `merchant_category_code` columns.
Step 2: Calculate the fee for a 50,000 EUR transaction for each rule in the `fees` DataFrame using the formula `fee = fixed_amount + (rate * 50000 / 10000)`, find the maximum fee, and extract the list of Merchant Category Codes (MCCs) associated with the rule(s) that yield this maximum fee.
