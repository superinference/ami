Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file into a dataframe and filter it to include only the transactions where the `merchant` is 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso', the `day_of_year` is 10, and the `year` is 2023.
Step 2: Load the `merchant_data.json` and `fees.json` files, then calculate the total monthly volume and fraud rate for 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' in January 2023 (days 1-31) using the full payments data to determine the applicable fee tier. Finally, iterate through the 84 transactions from day 10, match each against the fee rules (considering merchant attributes, transaction details, and the calculated monthly stats), compute the individual fees, and sum them up to get the total.
