Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file into a dataframe and filter for the row where `ID` is 787 to understand its current application criteria (such as card scheme, merchant category code, etc.).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` into a dataframe to map each merchant to their `account_type`, then load `payments.csv` and filter for transactions that match the Fee 787 criteria (`card_scheme` == 'NexPay', `is_credit` == False, and `aci` in ['C', 'A']), and finally identify the unique merchants from this filtered group that have an `account_type` of 'F'.
