Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file into a dataframe and filter it to include only rows where the `merchant` is 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse', the `year` is 2023, and the `day_of_year` corresponds to November (days 305 to 334).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the `account_type`, `merchant_category_code`, and `capture_delay` for 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse', and calculate the merchant's `monthly_volume` (total EUR amount) and `monthly_fraud_level` (fraudulent EUR volume / total EUR volume) from the filtered payments data for November 2023.
Step 3: Load `fees.json`, `merchant_data.json`, and `payments.csv`, filter for 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' transactions in November 2023 (days 305-334), calculate the merchant's total monthly volume and fraud rate to determine the applicable fee tiers, then iterate through each transaction to find the matching fee rule (considering card scheme, ACI, intracountry status, etc.) and calculate the total fees.
