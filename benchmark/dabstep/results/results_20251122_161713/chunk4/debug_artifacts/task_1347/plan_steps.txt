Step 1: Load the `merchant_category_codes.csv` file into a dataframe and filter the rows where the `description` column exactly matches "Drinking Places (Alcoholic Beverages) - Bars, Taverns, Nightclubs, Cocktail Lounges, and Discotheques" to retrieve the corresponding `mcc` value.
Step 2: Load the `fees.json` file into a dataframe, filter for rows where `card_scheme` is 'SwiftCharge', `account_type` contains 'H' (or is empty/null), and `merchant_category_code` contains 5813 (or is empty/null), then calculate the fee for each matching rule using the formula `fixed_amount + (rate * 100 / 10000)` and compute the average of these fees.
