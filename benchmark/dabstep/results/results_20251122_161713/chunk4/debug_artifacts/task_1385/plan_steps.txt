Step 1: Load the `merchant_category_codes.csv` file and filter the dataframe to find the merchant category code (mcc) corresponding to the description "Fast Food Restaurants".
Step 2: Load the `fees.json` file, filter for rules where `card_scheme` is 'GlobalCard', `account_type` contains 'H' (or is null/empty), and `merchant_category_code` contains 5814 (or is null/empty), then calculate the fee for a 1000 EUR transaction for each matching rule and compute the average.
Step 3: Load `merchant_category_codes.csv` to identify the MCC for "Fast Food Restaurants", then load `fees.json` and filter for rules where `card_scheme` is 'GlobalCard', `account_type` is either null, empty, or contains 'H', and `merchant_category_code` is either null, empty, or contains the identified MCC; for each matching rule, calculate the fee as `fixed_amount + (rate * 1000 / 10000)`, compute the average of these fees, and print the final answer formatted to 6 decimal places.
