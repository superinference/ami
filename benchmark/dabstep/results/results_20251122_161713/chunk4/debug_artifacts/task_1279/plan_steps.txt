Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` dataframe and filter for rows where `card_scheme` is 'SwiftCharge' and `is_credit` is True to identify the relevant set of transactions for weighting the fee calculation.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` and `fees.json`, then enrich the filtered payments DataFrame by merging merchant attributes (MCC, account type) and adding an `is_intracountry` column; additionally, calculate the average monthly volume for each merchant from the full `payments.csv` and merge this into the DataFrame.
Step 3: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`, filter for SwiftCharge credit transactions, and calculate monthly volume and fraud rates per merchant; then, enrich the transactions with merchant attributes and match each transaction to the correct fee rule to calculate the fee for a 50 EUR amount, finally computing the average fee.
