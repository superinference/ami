Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` dataframe and filter it to include only transactions for the merchant 'Rafa_AI' that occurred in March 2023 (specifically, where `day_of_year` is between 60 and 90).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, and `capture_delay` for 'Rafa_AI', calculate the fraud rate (fraud volume / total volume) for the filtered March 2023 transactions, and identify the unique combinations of `card_scheme`, `is_credit`, `aci`, and `intracountry` (where `issuing_country` equals `acquirer_country`) present in the data.
