Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` dataframe and filter for transactions where the `merchant` is 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' and the date corresponds to June 2023 (specifically, `day_of_year` between 152 and 181).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, and `capture_delay` for 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso', and calculate the total transaction volume and fraud rate (fraudulent volume / total volume) from the filtered June 2023 payments data to determine the applicable `monthly_volume` and `monthly_fraud_level` tiers.
Step 3: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`, filter for 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' transactions in June 2023 (days 152-181), calculate the merchant's total volume and fraud rate to identify the correct `monthly_volume` and `monthly_fraud_level` buckets, and then iterate through each transaction to find the applicable fee rule by matching all criteria (including `capture_delay`, `account_type`, `mcc`, `aci`, `intracountry`, etc.) to calculate and sum the total fees.
