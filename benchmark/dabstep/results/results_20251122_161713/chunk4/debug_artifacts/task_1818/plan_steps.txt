Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file into a dataframe and filter the rows to include only transactions where the `merchant` is 'Belles_cookbook_store' and the date corresponds to August 2023 (using the `year` and `day_of_year` columns).
Step 2: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`. Filter payments for 'Belles_cookbook_store' in August 2023 (day_of_year 213-243). Calculate the merchant's total monthly volume and fraud rate for August. Then, for each transaction, find the applicable fee rule from `fees.json` by matching all criteria (card_scheme, account_type, merchant_category_code, is_credit, aci, intracountry, monthly_volume, monthly_fraud_level), handling nulls/empty lists as wildcards. Calculate the fee for each transaction using the formula `fixed_amount + (rate * eur_amount / 10000)` and sum them up to get the total fees.
