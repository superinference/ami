Step 1: Load `payments.csv` and filter for rows where `merchant` is 'Crossfit_Hanna' and `year` is 2023.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` and `fees.json`, then using the filtered transaction data, calculate the monthly total volume and monthly fraud rate (fraud volume / total volume) for the merchant 'Crossfit_Hanna' in 2023, and add an 'intracountry' column (True if issuing_country equals acquirer_country) and a 'month' column to the transactions.
Step 3: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`, filter for 'Crossfit_Hanna' transactions in 2023, calculate monthly volume and fraud rates, then for each transaction calculate the fee difference by applying the fee rules using the original MCC versus the hypothetical MCC 5911, and finally sum these differences to find the total amount delta.
