Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter for transactions where the merchant is 'Rafa_AI', the month is September (day_of_year between 244 and 273), and `has_fraudulent_dispute` is True.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` and `fees.json` to retrieve Rafa_AI's attributes (account type, MCC) and fee structures. Then, using the filtered September transactions for Rafa_AI, calculate the total monthly volume and fraud rate to determine applicable fee buckets. Finally, for the subset of fraudulent transactions, simulate changing the ACI to each possible value (A, B, C, D, E, F), calculate the resulting total fees based on the matching rules in `fees.json`, and identify the ACI that results in the lowest fees.
