Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file into a dataframe and filter it to retrieve the details of the fee with ID 64 (specifically its current `account_type`, `card_scheme`, `merchant_category_code`, etc.), and also load `merchant_data.json` to identify the account types of all merchants.
Step 2: Load `fees.json` to retrieve the `card_scheme` and `merchant_category_code` list for Fee ID 64, load `merchant_data.json` to get each merchant's `merchant_category_code` and `account_type`, and load `payments.csv` to confirm which merchants process the specific `card_scheme`; then identify merchants who match the original Fee 64 criteria (scheme and MCC) but would be excluded by the new restriction (i.e., their `account_type` is not 'F').
