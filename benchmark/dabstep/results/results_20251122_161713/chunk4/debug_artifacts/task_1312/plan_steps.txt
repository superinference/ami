Step 1: Load the `merchant_category_codes.csv` file into a dataframe and filter the rows where the `description` column exactly matches "Eating Places and Restaurants" to retrieve the corresponding Merchant Category Code (MCC).
Step 2: Load the `fees.json` file, filter for rules where `card_scheme` is 'TransactPlus', `account_type` contains 'H' (or is empty/null), and `merchant_category_code` contains 5812 (or is empty/null), then calculate the fee for each matching rule using the formula `fee = fixed_amount + (rate * 50 / 10000)` and compute the average of these fees.
