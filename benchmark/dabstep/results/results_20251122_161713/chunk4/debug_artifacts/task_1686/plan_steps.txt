Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` dataset and filter for transactions where `merchant` is 'Belles_cookbook_store', `year` is 2023, and `day_of_year` is 365.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the account type, merchant category code, and capture delay for 'Belles_cookbook_store'. Calculate the merchant's total transaction volume and fraud rate (fraud volume / total volume) for December 2023 (days 335-365) using `payments.csv`. Finally, load `fees.json` and determine the applicable Fee IDs for the transactions on day 365 by matching all criteria (transaction attributes, merchant attributes, and monthly stats).
