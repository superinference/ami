Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file into a dataframe to access the fee rules.
Step 2: To answer the question about the average fee for account type D and card scheme GlobalCard, I need to identify the relevant fee rules from the `fees.json` dataset. The fee is calculated using the formula `fee = fixed_amount + (rate * transaction_value / 10000)`. I will filter the fee rules to find those applicable to 'GlobalCard' and 'Account Type D', calculate the fee for a transaction value of 1234 EUR for each matching rule, and then compute the average.

My next step is to filter the `fees` DataFrame and calculate the average fee.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Filter for GlobalCard
global_card_fees = fees_df[fees_df['card_scheme'] == 'GlobalCard']

# Filter for Account Type D
# We check if 'D' is in the account_type list. 
# We assume account_type is a list of strings.
account_type_d_rules = global_card_fees[global_card_fees['account_type'].apply(lambda x: 'D' in x if isinstance(x, list) else False)]

# Calculate fee for each rule: fixed_amount + (rate * 1234 / 10000)
# transaction_value = 1234
