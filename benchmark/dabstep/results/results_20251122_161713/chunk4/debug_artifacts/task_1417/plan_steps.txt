Step 1: Load the `merchant_category_codes.csv` file and filter the rows where the `description` column exactly matches "Taxicabs and Limousines" to retrieve the corresponding Merchant Category Code (MCC).
Step 2: Load the `fees.json` file and filter for rules where `card_scheme` is 'GlobalCard', `account_type` contains 'H' (or is empty), and `merchant_category_code` contains 4121 (or is empty). Then, for each matching rule, calculate the fee for a 1000 EUR transaction using the formula `fee = fixed_amount + (rate * 1000 / 10000)`, compute the average of these fees, and round the result to 6 decimal places.
