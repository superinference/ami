Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file into a pandas DataFrame to access the fee rules and their associated characteristics (fixed amounts, rates, ACIs, card schemes, etc.).
Step 2: Filter the `fees` DataFrame to include only rows where `card_scheme` is 'TransactPlus' and `is_credit` is either `True` or `NaN`, calculate the transaction fee for each rule using the formula `fee = fixed_amount + (rate * 1000 / 10000)`, explode the `aci` column (filling `NaN` values with all possible ACIs: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']), and finally identify the ACI associated with the highest fee, resolving ties by alphabetical order.
