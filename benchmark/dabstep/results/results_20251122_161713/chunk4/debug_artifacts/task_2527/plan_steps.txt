Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file and filter for the entry where `ID` is 454 to retrieve the specific criteria (such as card scheme, account type, merchant category code, etc.) required to identify the affected transactions.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` and `payments.csv`, then calculate the total monthly transaction volume for each merchant in 2023 (converting `day_of_year` to months) to identify which merchant-months fall within the '100k-1m' range (100,000 to 1,000,000 EUR), and finally filter for merchants who had transactions in those specific months that also match the fee's criteria: `card_scheme` is 'TransactPlus' and `account_type` is in ["R", "D", "H", "F", "S"].
