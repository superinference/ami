Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions for the merchant 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' during the month of July (specifically, where `day_of_year` is between 182 and 212), while also loading `fees.json` and `merchant_data.json` to access the necessary fee rules and merchant attributes.

2.  **Calculate Monthly Metrics**: Calculate the total `eur_amount` (monthly volume) and the fraud rate (volume of transactions with `has_fraudulent_dispute == True` / total volume) for this merchant in July. Convert these into the format used in `fees.json` (e.g., "100k-1m", ">8.3%").
3.  **Enrich Transaction Data**: Merge the filtered payments with `merchant_data.json` to add `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, and `capture_delay`. Determine `intracountry` status for each transaction (
