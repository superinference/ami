Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions where the `merchant` is "Crossfit_Hanna", the `year` is 2023, and the `day_of_year` is 100.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` and `fees.json`, calculate the monthly volume and fraud rate for "Crossfit_Hanna" for April 2023 (since day 100 falls in April) using the full `payments.csv`, and then iterate through the transactions of day 100 to find all Fee IDs from `fees.json` that match the transaction attributes (card scheme, credit status, ACI, intracountry) and merchant attributes (MCC, account type, capture delay, calculated monthly stats).
