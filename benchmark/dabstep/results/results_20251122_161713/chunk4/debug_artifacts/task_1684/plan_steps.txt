Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file into a dataframe and filter it to include only rows where `merchant` is 'Belles_cookbook_store', `year` is 2023, and `day_of_year` is 200.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the `account_type`, `merchant_category_code`, and `capture_delay` for 'Belles_cookbook_store', calculate the total transaction volume and fraud rate for this merchant for July 2023 (days 182-212) using `payments.csv`, and then iterate through the transactions from day 200 against `fees.json` to identify and list all applicable Fee IDs based on the matching criteria (card scheme, account type, MCC, ACI, is_credit, intracountry, volume, fraud level, and capture delay).
