Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the dataframe to include only rows where the `merchant` column is 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso', the `year` is 2023, and the `day_of_year` is between 1 and 31 (representing January).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the merchant's attributes (MCC, account type, capture delay) and `fees.json` for the fee rules. Calculate the total volume and fraud rate for the filtered January 2023 transactions. Then, identify the applicable Fee IDs by matching the merchant's attributes, calculated monthly stats, and unique transaction characteristics (card scheme, credit status, ACI, intracountry status) against the fee rules.
