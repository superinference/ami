Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions for the merchant 'Crossfit_Hanna' that occurred in April 2023 (which corresponds to `day_of_year` values 91 through 120).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the account details (MCC, account type, capture delay) for 'Crossfit_Hanna', calculate the merchant's `monthly_volume` and `monthly_fraud_level` (fraud volume / total volume) using the April 2023 transactions, and then iterate through these transactions to calculate the total fees by finding the matching rule in `fees.json` for each transaction (based on merchant and transaction attributes like `intracountry`, `aci`, `is_credit`, etc.) and applying the formula `fee = fixed_amount + (rate * eur_amount / 10000)`.
