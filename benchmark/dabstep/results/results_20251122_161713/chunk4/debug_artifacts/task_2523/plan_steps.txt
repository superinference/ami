Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file and filter the data to retrieve the specific fee rule details where the `ID` is equal to 12.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to identify merchants with `merchant_category_code` in `[5411, 5412, 5499, 5912, 5812, 5813, 5911, 5983]`, then load `payments.csv` to filter transactions from 2023 where `card_scheme` is 'SwiftCharge' and `aci` is in `['C', 'B']`, and finally identify which of the MCC-filtered merchants appear in these filtered transactions.
Step 3: Load `fees.json` to retrieve the full criteria for Fee ID 12 (specifically checking `is_credit`, `intracountry`, and `capture_delay` requirements), then load `payments.csv` and `merchant_data.json` to filter 2023 transactions that match *all* Fee 12 criteria, and report the unique merchants.
