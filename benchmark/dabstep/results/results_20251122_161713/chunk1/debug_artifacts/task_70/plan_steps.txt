Step 1: Load `payments.csv`, filter for the merchant "Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse", and calculate its fraud rate (defined as the ratio of transactions with `has_fraudulent_dispute` = True to the total number of transactions for that merchant).
Step 2: Load `payments.csv`, filter for the merchant "Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse", calculate the fraud rate based on volume (sum of `eur_amount` where `has_fraudulent_dispute` is True divided by total `eur_amount`), and then check `manual.md` for any defined fraud rate thresholds or penalties to determine if the merchant is in danger of a fine.
