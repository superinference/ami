Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file into a pandas DataFrame to inspect the available fee rules, specifically focusing on columns that represent variable factors (like `monthly_volume`, `monthly_fraud_level`, `capture_delay`) and the target variable `rate`.
Step 2: Analyze the relationship between `rate` and the factors `monthly_volume`, `monthly_fraud_level`, and `capture_delay` by converting their string ranges into ordinal categories (e.g., Volume: '<100k' -> 1, '100k-1m' -> 2, etc.) and calculating the average fee rate for each level to determine which factor correlates with lower rates as it increases.
