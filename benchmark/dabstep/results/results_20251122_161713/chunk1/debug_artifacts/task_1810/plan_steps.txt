Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` dataframe and filter for transactions where `merchant` is 'Rafa_AI', `year` is 2023, and `day_of_year` corresponds to December (days 335 to 365).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, and `capture_delay` for 'Rafa_AI', then calculate the total transaction volume and fraud rate (based on `has_fraudulent_dispute`) for 'Rafa_AI' in December 2023 using the filtered payments data, and finally load `fees.json` to identify which Fee IDs match the merchant's profile, monthly statistics, and the specific transaction characteristics (card scheme, credit status, ACI, intracountry status) present in the December data.
