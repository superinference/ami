Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file into a dataframe and filter for transactions where the `year` is 2023.
Step 2: Calculate the Z-score for the `eur_amount` column, classify transactions as outliers (Z-score > 3) or inliers, calculate the fraud rate for each group, and compare them to determine if the outlier fraud rate is higher.
