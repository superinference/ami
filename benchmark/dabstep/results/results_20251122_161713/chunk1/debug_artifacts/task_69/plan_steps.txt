Step 1: To answer the question about the highest volume at which fees do not become cheaper, I need to analyze the relationship between `monthly_volume` and the fee components (`rate` and `fixed_amount`) in the `fees.json` file.

I will calculate the average fee rates for each volume tier, sort them logically, and inspect the trend.

```python
import pandas as pd
import json

# Load the fees data
with open('fees.json', 'r') as f:
    fees_data = json.load(f)

df_fees = pd.DataFrame(fees_data)

# Filter for rows where monthly_volume is defined (not None)
df_vol = df_fees[df_fees['monthly_volume'].notna()].copy()

# Define a mapping for sorting the volume ranges logically
volume_order = {
    '<100k': 0,
    '100k-1m': 1,
    '1m-5m': 2,
    '>5m': 3
}

# Map the sorting order
df_vol['vol_order'] = df_vol['monthly_volume'].map(volume_order)

# Group by monthly_volume and calculate average rate and fixed_amount
# Also keep the vol_order for sorting
fee_stats = df_vol.groupby('monthly_volume').agg({
    'rate': 'mean',
    'fixed_amount': 'mean',
    'vol_order
