## 5. Understanding Payment Processing Fees

Payment Processing Fees depend on a number of characteristics. These characteristics belong to either the merchant or the transaction.

Merchant characteritics include 

* **ID**: identifier of the fee rule within the rule fee dataset
* **card_scheme**: string type. name of the card scheme or network that the fee applies to
* **account_type**: list type. list of account types according to the categorization `Account Type` in this manual
* **capture_delay**: string type. rule that specifies the number of days in which the capture from authorization to settlement needs to happen. Possible values are '3-5' (between 3 and 5 days), '>5' (more than 5 days is possible), '<3' (before 3 days), 'immediate', or 'manual'. The faster the capture to settlement happens, the more expensive it is.
* **monthly_fraud_level**: string type. rule that specifies the fraud levels measured as ratio between monthly total volume and monthly volume notified as fraud. For example '7.7%-8.3%' means that the ratio should be between 7.7 and 8.3 percent. Generally, the payment processors will become more expensive as fraud rate increases.
* **monthly_volume**: string type. rule that specifies the monthly total volume of the merchant. '100k-1m' is between 100.000 (100k) and 1.000.000 (1m). All volumes are specified in euros. Normally merchants with higher volume are able to get cheaper fees from payments processors.
* **merchant_category_code**: list type. integer that specifies the possible merchant category codes, according to the categorization found in this manual in the section `Merchant Category Code`. eg: `[8062, 8011, 8021]`.
* **is_credit**: bool. True if the rule applies for credit transactions. Typically credit transactions are more expensive (higher fee).
* **aci**: list type. string that specifies an array of possible Authorization Characteristics Indicator (ACI) according to the categorization specified in this manual in the section `Authorization Characteristics Indicator`.
* **fixed_amount**: float. Fixed amount of the fee in euros per transaction, for the given rule.
* **rate**: integer. Variable rate to be especified to be multiplied by the transaction value and divided by 10000.
* **intracountry**: bool. True if the transaction is domestic, defined by the fact that the issuer country and the acquiring country are the same. False are for international transactions where the issuer country and acquirer country are different and typically are more expensive.

**Notes**:
* The fee then is provided by `fee = fixed_amount + rate * transaction_value / 10000`.
* Monthly volumes and rates are computed always in natural months (e.g. January, February), starting always in day 1 and ending in the last natural day of the month (i.e. 28 for February, 30 or 31).
* Fixed amount and transaction values are given in the same currency, typically euros.
* If a field is set to null it means that it applies to all possible values of that field. E.g. null value in aci means that the rules applies for all possible values of aci.

The full list of fee rules and values depending on these characteristics can be found in the annexed file `fees.json`. 

###  5.1 Best Practices for Minimizing Transaction Costs


#### 5.1.1 Optimizing Transactions through Local Acquiring

To minimize friction and maximize conversion rates, it is essential to route transactions through local acquirers. Local acquiring refers to the scenario where the issuer country is the same as the acquirer country. This approach can lead to several benefits, including:

- Reduced transaction friction, resulting in higher conversion rates
- Lower fees associated with cross-border transactions

**What is Local Acquiring?**

Local acquiring occurs when a transaction is processed through an acquirer that is located in the same country as the issuer of the card. For example, if a cardholder is located in the United States and makes a purchase from a merchant also located in the United States, the transaction would be considered a local acquiring transaction.

By routing transactions through local acquirers, merchants can reduce the complexity and costs associated with cross-border transactions, ultimately leading to a better user experience and increased conversion rates.

**Benefits of Local Acquiring**

Some of the key benefits of local acquiring include:

- Reduced transaction fees
- Improved conversion rates due to reduced friction
- Enhanced user experience
- Simplified transaction processing

#### 5.1.2. Choosing the right transaction type

**Transaction Processing Options and Fees**

When processing transactions, there are various options available, depending on the type of transaction and the level of authentication required. The Authorization Characteristic Indicator (ACI) provides a standardized way to categorize transactions and determine the best processing method.

**Transaction Processing Methods**

Transactions can be processed in one of several ways, including:

- POS transactions with authentication: This method involves verifying the cardholder's identity through authentication, such as entering a PIN or signature.
- Tokenized transactions: This method involves replacing the cardholder's sensitive information with a token or pseudonym, which can be used to process the transaction.

**Choosing the Right ACI**

When choosing an ACI, consider the following factors:

- Fees: Different ACIs have varying fees associated with them. Choosing the right ACI can help reduce costs, but may also add friction to the transaction process.
- Friction: Some ACIs, such as those that require authentication, may add friction to the transaction process, such as prompting the cardholder to enter a PIN or signature.

**Understanding ACI Codes**

ACI codes are provided in the section `Authorization Characteristics Indicator` and are used to categorize transactions and determine the best processing method. By choosing the right ACI, merchants can optimize their transaction processing and reduce costs.

**Best Practices for Choosing an ACI**

When choosing an ACI, follow these best practices:

- Consider the type of transaction: Different ACIs are suited for different types of transactions, such as POS transactions or e-commerce transactions.
- Consider the level of authentication required: Choose an ACI that provides the required level of authentication, such as authentication or tokenization.
- Consider the fees associated with the ACI: Choose an ACI that balances fees with the level of authentication required and the type of transaction.


# 5.1.3 Processing with Higher Volumes

## Pricing Structure Overview

When processing larger volumes of data, the cost per unit decreases, resulting in a more cost-effective solution. Unlike some pricing models, there is no minimum volume requirement, allowing you to benefit from economies of scale as your needs grow.

## Volume-Based Pricing Curve

The pricing curve is designed to flatten out at higher volumes, ensuring that the cost per unit remains competitive as your volume increases. This means that the more data you process, the lower the cost per unit, allowing you to optimize your budget and achieve a better return on investment.

## Key Benefits

*   No minimum volume requirement, giving you flexibility in your pricing strategy
*   Economies of scale achieved as your volume increases, reducing the cost per unit
*   Competitive pricing at higher volumes, ensuring a better return on investment

#### 5.1.4 Minimizing Fraud-Related Costs

**Understanding the Impact of Fraud Levels**

When processing transactions, it's essential to maintain optimal fraud levels to minimize costs. As fraud levels increase, so do the associated costs. To maximize efficiency and reduce expenses, it's recommended to maintain fraud levels at the lowest possible threshold.

**The Relationship Between Fraud Levels and Costs**

Our pricing model is designed to reflect the increased risk associated with higher fraud levels. As a result, costs will increase in direct proportion to the level of fraud detected. By maintaining optimal fraud levels, you can help reduce these costs and optimize your budget.

**Best Practices for Minimizing Fraud-Related Fees**

For more information on strategies for reducing fraud-related fees, please refer to the `Reducing Fraud-Related Fees` section of this manual. This section provides guidance on how to implement effective anti-fraud measures, monitor transactions, and respond to potential threats.

#### 5.1.5 Avoiding Transaction Downgrades

Transaction downgrades can result in higher processing costs due to less favorable interchange rate tiers. To minimize the risk of downgrades, it is essential to understand the common reasons for downgrades and implement best practices to avoid them.

**Common Reasons for Transaction Downgrades**
- Missing or Incomplete Data Elements: Failing to provide required data elements can lead to downgrades.
- Late Settlement: Settling transactions outside of the designated timeframe can result in downgrades.
- Non-Qualified Transaction Types: Processing transactions that do not meet specific criteria can lead to downgrades.
- Failure to Use AVS or 3D Secure for Card-Not-Present Transactions: Not utilizing enhanced security features for card-not-present transactions can result in downgrades.
- Transaction Size and Volume: Excessive transaction size or volume can lead to downgrades.
- Excessive retrying: Retrying transactions too many times can result in downgrades.

**Best Practices to Avoid Downgrades**

-**Ensure Complete Data Submission**: Provide all required data elements to avoid downgrades.
- **Timely Settlement (within 24 hours)**: Settle transactions within the designated timeframe to avoid downgrades.
- **Use Retry Strategies that Consider Cost and Penalties**: Implement retry strategies that balance cost and penalties to avoid downgrades.
- **Utilize Enhanced Security Features**: Use AVS and 3D Secure for card-not-present transactions to avoid downgrades.
- **Leverage Level 2 and Level 3 Data for B2B Transactions**: Use Level 2 and Level 3 data for B2B transactions to avoid downgrades.
- **Regularly Review and Update Your Systems**: Regularly review and update your systems to ensure compliance with industry standards and avoid downgrades.
- **Train Your Staff**: Train your staff to understand the importance of avoiding downgrades and provide them with the necessary tools and resources to do so.


### 6. PIN Entry Attempt Limits

#### Preventing Unauthorized Access

To maintain the security and integrity of your transactions, we have implemented a PIN entry attempt limit to prevent unauthorized access to your account. This limit is designed to protect you from potential losses due to repeated incorrect PIN attempts.

#### Attempt Limit Details

*   **Maximum Attempts:** Three (3) consecutive incorrect PIN entry attempts are allowed before the card is temporarily blocked.
*   **Temporary Block:** If the attempt limit is reached, your card will be temporarily blocked, and you will be unable to make transactions until the block is lifted.
*   **Unblocking the Card:** To unblock your card or reset your PIN, please contact your issuing bank directly. They will be able to assist you in resolving the issue and reactivating your card for use.
*   **Security Measures:** This limit is in place to prevent unauthorized access to your account and to protect you from potential losses. By limiting the number of incorrect PIN attempts, we can help ensure that your account remains secure and that you can continue to use your card with confidence.

--- Analysis of Relationships ---

Factor: capture_delay
Description: * **capture_delay**: string type. rule that specifies the number of days in which the capture from authorization to settlement needs to happen. Possible values are '3-5' (between 3 and 5 days), '>5' (more than 5 days is possible), '<3' (before 3 days), 'immediate', or 'manual'. The faster the capture to settlement happens, the more expensive it is.
-> Relationship: Decreasing delay (faster) increases cost.

Factor: monthly_fraud_level
Description: * **monthly_fraud_level**: string type. rule that specifies the fraud levels measured as ratio between monthly total volume and monthly volume notified as fraud. For example '7.7%-8.3%' means that the ratio should be between 7.7 and 8.3 percent. Generally, the payment processors will become more expensive as fraud rate increases.
-> Relationship: Decreasing fraud level decreases cost (Cheaper).

Factor: monthly_volume
Description: * **monthly_volume**: string type. rule that specifies the monthly total volume of the merchant. '100k-1m' is between 100.000 (100k) and 1.000.000 (1m). All volumes are specified in euros. Normally merchants with higher volume are able to get cheaper fees from payments processors.
-> Relationship: Decreasing volume increases cost (loss of bulk discount).

--- Final Answer ---
The factor that contributes to a cheaper fee rate if its value is decreased is: monthly_fraud_level
