Step 1: Filter the `payments.csv` dataframe to retrieve all transactions where the `merchant` is 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso', the `year` is 2023, and `has_fraudulent_dispute` is True.
Step 2: Load the `merchant_data.json` and `fees.json` files, and filter the `payments.csv` dataset to retrieve all transactions for the merchant 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' in 2023. Then, calculate the monthly total volume and monthly fraud rate (ratio of fraudulent volume to total volume) for this merchant to determine the applicable fee tiers for each month.
Step 3: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`, then filter for 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' transactions in 2023 to calculate monthly total volumes and fraud rates (ratio of fraudulent to total volume) for determining fee tiers. Isolate the fraudulent transactions and, for each possible Authorization Characteristics Indicator (ACI) ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'], calculate the total hypothetical fees by applying the matching rules from `fees.json` (considering card scheme, account type, merchant category code, capture delay, is_credit, intracountry status, and the calculated monthly volume/fraud tiers), finally identifying the ACI that results in the lowest total fees.
