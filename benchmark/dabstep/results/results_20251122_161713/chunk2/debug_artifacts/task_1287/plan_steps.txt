Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file into a dataframe and filter for rows where `card_scheme` is 'SwiftCharge' and `is_credit` is True.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` and `fees.json`, then calculate monthly transaction volume and fraud rates (fraudulent volume / total volume) for each merchant using the full `payments.csv` dataset. Finally, enrich the filtered SwiftCharge DataFrame (`df_filtered`) by merging these monthly stats, adding merchant metadata (MCC, account type, capture delay) from `merchant_data.json`, and creating an `intracountry` column (True if `issuing_country` equals `acquirer_country`).
Step 3: Output the final answer: The average fee for a transaction value of 500 EUR for SwiftCharge credit transactions is 2.79 EUR.
