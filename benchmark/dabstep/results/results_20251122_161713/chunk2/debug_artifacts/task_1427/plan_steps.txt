Step 1: To answer this question, I will first load the `merchant_category_codes.csv` file and filter the dataframe to find the specific merchant category code (mcc) associated with the description "Taxicabs and Limousines".
Step 2: Load the `fees.json` file, filter for rules where `card_scheme` is 'SwiftCharge', `account_type` contains 'H' or is empty, and `merchant_category_code` contains 4121 or is empty; then for each matching rule, calculate the fee using the formula `fee = fixed_amount + (rate * 1234 / 10000)`, compute the average of these fees, and output the result in EUR with 6 decimal places.
