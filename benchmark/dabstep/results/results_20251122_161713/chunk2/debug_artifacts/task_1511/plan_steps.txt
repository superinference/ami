Step 1: Load the "fees.json" file into a dataframe and display the first 5 rows and the columns and their types to discern how to proceed.
Step 2: For each rule in the `fees` dataframe, calculate the fee for a transaction value of 500 EUR using the formula `fixed_amount + (rate * 500 / 10000)`, then group by `card_scheme` to calculate the average fee for each scheme and identify the one with the lowest average.
