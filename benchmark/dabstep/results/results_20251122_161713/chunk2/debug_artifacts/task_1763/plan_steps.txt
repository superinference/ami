Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions for the merchant 'Crossfit_Hanna' that occurred in January 2023 (where `day_of_year` is between 1 and 31).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the static attributes (merchant_category_code, account_type, capture_delay) for 'Crossfit_Hanna', load `fees.json`, and then using the previously calculated total volume and fraud volume (to determine the monthly tiers) and the unique transaction attributes (card_scheme, is_credit, aci, and intracountry status derived from issuing_country and acquirer_country) from the filtered payments data, identify and list all Fee IDs from `fees.json` that match the transactions.
