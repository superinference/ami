Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` dataframe and filter for rows where `merchant` is 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' and `day_of_year` is between 182 and 212 (representing July 2023).
Step 2: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`, filter for 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' transactions in July 2023 (days 182-212), calculate the merchant's monthly volume and fraud rate to determine applicable fee tiers, then iterate through each transaction to find the matching fee rule (handling wildcards, ranges, and list inclusions for attributes like account type, MCC, and ACI) and sum the calculated fees.
