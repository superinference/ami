Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file into a pandas DataFrame and filter the rows to include only transactions where the `merchant` is 'Rafa_AI', the `card_scheme` is 'SwiftCharge', and the `day_of_year` is between 121 and 181 (representing May 1st to June 30th, 2023).
Step 2: Group the filtered data by `device_type` and calculate the mean of the `eur_amount` column to determine the average transaction value for each device type.
