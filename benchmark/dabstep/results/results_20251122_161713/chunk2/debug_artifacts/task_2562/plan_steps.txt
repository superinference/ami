Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file and filter for the row with `ID` 384 to identify its current matching criteria (such as card scheme, merchant category code, and current account type settings).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the `account_type` for each merchant, and load `payments.csv` to identify merchants with transactions matching Fee 384's criteria (`card_scheme`='NexPay', `is_credit`=True, `aci` in ['C', 'B']), then determine which of these merchants have an `account_type` other than 'F'.
