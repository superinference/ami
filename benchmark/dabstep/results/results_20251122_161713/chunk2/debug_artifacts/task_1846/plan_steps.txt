Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions for the merchant 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' that occurred in December 2023 (where `day_of_year` is greater than or equal to 335).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the profile for 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' (including `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, and `capture_delay`), calculate the total transaction volume and fraud rate for December 2023 to determine the applicable volume and fraud level buckets, and load `fees.json`.
Step 3: Use Python to calculate the total fees for 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' in December 2023. First, filter `payments.csv` for the merchant and date (day_of_year >= 335). Second, retrieve the merchant's `account_type`, `merchant_category_code`, and `capture_delay` from `merchant_data.json`. Third, calculate the merchant's total volume and fraud rate (fraud volume / total volume) for December to determine the applicable `monthly_volume` and `monthly_fraud_level` buckets. Finally, iterate through the transactions, match each one to the correct rule in `fees.json` based on transaction attributes (`card_scheme`, `is_credit`, `aci`, `intracountry`) and merchant/monthly attributes, calculate the fee (`fixed_amount + rate * amount / 10000`), and sum the total fees.
