Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter for transactions where the merchant is 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso', the month is July (day_of_year 182-212), and the transaction is marked as fraudulent (`has_fraudulent_dispute` is True).
Step 2: Calculate the total monthly volume and fraud rate for 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' in July (days 182-212) using the payments data, retrieve the merchant's metadata (account_type, merchant_category_code, capture_delay) from `merchant_data.json`, and then for each possible ACI (A, B, C, D, E, F, G), calculate the total projected fees for the previously identified fraudulent transactions by matching them against the rules in `fees.json`.
