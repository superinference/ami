Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file and extract the fee rule with `ID=398` to determine its original `rate` and the specific criteria (such as card scheme, ACI, etc.) required to match transactions.
Step 2: Load `fees.json` to extract the original rate and all matching conditions for fee ID 398, then load `merchant_data.json` to get Crossfit_Hanna's attributes, and finally load `payments.csv` to calculate the monthly fraud rates and volumes for Crossfit_Hanna in 2023, filtering for transactions that match all of Rule 398's criteria (including dynamic monthly thresholds) to compute the total transaction value subject to this fee and the resulting delta using the formula `(99 - original_rate) * total_value / 10000`.
