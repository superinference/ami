Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file and retrieve the fee rule with ID 384 to identify its current matching criteria (such as card scheme, merchant category codes, and existing account type restrictions).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the `account_type` for each merchant, and load `payments.csv` to identify merchants who processed transactions matching Fee 384's criteria (`card_scheme`='NexPay', `is_credit`=True, `aci` in ['B', 'C']), then filter for those whose account type is not 'O'.
