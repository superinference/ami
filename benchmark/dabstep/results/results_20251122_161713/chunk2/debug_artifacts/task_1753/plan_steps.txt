Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions where the `merchant` is "Belles_cookbook_store" and the date corresponds to March 2023 (specifically, `year` is 2023 and `day_of_year` is between 60 and 90).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the attributes for 'Belles_cookbook_store', calculate the total monthly volume and fraud rate for this merchant in March 2023 using `payments.csv`, and then cross-reference these values along with the transaction attributes (card scheme, ACI, is_credit, intracountry status) against `fees.json` to identify all applicable Fee IDs.
