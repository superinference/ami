Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file and retrieve the fee rule with `ID` equal to 64 to understand its current criteria (such as card scheme, merchant category codes, and existing account type restrictions).
Step 2: Load `fees.json`, `merchant_data.json`, and `payments.csv`. Extract the rule for Fee ID 64. Identify merchants with transactions in 2023 that match the fee's criteria (card scheme, MCC, ACI, etc.), ignoring the account type initially. For these matching merchants, compare their eligibility under the original `account_type` constraint versus the new constraint (`account_type` = 'H') to determine which merchants would either start or stop paying the fee.
