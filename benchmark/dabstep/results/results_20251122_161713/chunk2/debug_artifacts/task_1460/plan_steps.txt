Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file into a dataframe and filter for rules where `card_scheme` is 'NexPay' and `is_credit` is either True or null (wildcard), as these are the primary constraints for the transaction.
Step 2: Calculate the fee for each rule in the filtered dataframe using the formula `fee = fixed_amount + rate` (since the transaction amount is 10000), expand the `aci` column to handle lists and wildcards (where `None` implies all ACIs: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']), find the maximum fee associated with each ACI, and identify the ACI with the highest fee (resolving ties by alphabetical order).
