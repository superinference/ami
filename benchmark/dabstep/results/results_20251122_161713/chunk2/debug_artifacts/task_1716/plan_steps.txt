Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file into a dataframe and filter for transactions where the merchant is 'Belles_cookbook_store', the year is 2023, and the day of the year is 365.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to get the merchant's attributes, and `fees.json` for the fee rules. Then, process `payments.csv` to calculate the total transaction volume and fraud rate for 'Belles_cookbook_store' for December 2023 (days 335-365). Finally, for each transaction on day 365, find the matching fee rule based on the merchant's attributes, monthly stats, and transaction details, and calculate the total fees.
Step 3: To ensure the accuracy of the fee calculation, I will perform a step that calculates the fees by strictly matching the fee rules and verifying the intermediate values (like monthly volume and fraud rate) and the rule matching logic for a sample transaction.

**Plan:**
Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`. Filter payments for 'Belles_cookbook_store' in December 2023 (days 335-365) to calculate the merchant's monthly transaction volume and fraud rate. Then, for each transaction on day 365, identify the applicable fee rule from `fees.json` by matching all criteria (card scheme, credit status, ACI, account type, merchant category code, capture delay, monthly volume, monthly fraud level, and intracountry status). Calculate the fee for each transaction using the formula `fee = fixed_amount + (rate * amount / 10000)`, sum the fees to get the total for the day, and print the final result.
