Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file into a pandas DataFrame and filter the data to include only transactions where the `merchant` is 'Belles_cookbook_store', the `card_scheme` is 'SwiftCharge', and the `day_of_year` is between 1 and 59 (inclusive, representing January and February 2023).
Step 2: Group the filtered DataFrame by 'aci' and calculate the mean of the 'eur_amount' column, then round the results to two decimal places.
