Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions for the merchant 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' that occurred in July (calculating the month from the `day_of_year` column, where July corresponds to days 182 through 212 in a non-leap year like 2023).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the account details (MCC, account type, capture delay) for 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse', then load `payments.csv` to extract the July transactions (day_of_year 182-212) to calculate the monthly fraud volume and total volume, and finally use `fees.json` to calculate and compare the total fees for each card scheme if applied to these transactions.
