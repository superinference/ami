Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter for transactions where the merchant is 'Rafa_AI', the month is October (derived from `day_of_year` between 274 and 304), and `has_fraudulent_dispute` is True.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to get Rafa_AI's attributes, load `fees.json` for fee rules, and process `payments.csv` to calculate Rafa_AI's October total volume and fraud rate for fee tier determination; then, using the fraudulent transactions in `rafa_oct_fraud.csv`, calculate the total projected fees for each possible Authorization Characteristics Indicator (ACI) to find the lowest cost option.
