Step 1: Filter the `payments.csv` dataset to include only transactions for the merchant 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' in the year 2023, calculate the average `eur_amount`, and retrieve the merchant's metadata (specifically `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, and `acquirer`) from `merchant_data.json`.
Step 2: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`. Filter `payments.csv` for merchant 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' in 2023 to calculate the average transaction amount, total monthly volume, monthly fraud rate, and identify the most frequent values for `is_credit`, `aci`, and `intracountry` (based on `issuing_country` vs `acquirer_country`). Retrieve the merchant's `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, and `capture_delay` from `merchant_data.json`. Finally, iterate through `fees.json` to find the applicable fee rule for each card scheme (matching the merchant's profile and transaction characteristics) and calculate the estimated fee per transaction to determine which scheme yields the highest fees.
