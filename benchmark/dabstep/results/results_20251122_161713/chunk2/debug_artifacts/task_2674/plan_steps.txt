Step 1: Filter the `payments.csv` dataset to include only transactions for the merchant 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' that occurred in October (where `day_of_year` is between 274 and 304).
Step 2: Calculate the fraud volume and fraud rate for 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' in October using the filtered transactions, then load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the merchant's `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, and `capture_delay`.
Step 3: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`. Filter the payments for 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' in October (day_of_year 274-304), calculate the merchant's total monthly volume and fraud rate to determine the applicable fee tiers, and then for each card scheme found in `fees.json`, calculate the total theoretical cost of these transactions by matching each transaction to the correct fee rule (based on merchant attributes and transaction properties like `is_credit`, `aci`, and `intracountry`) to identify the scheme with the minimum fees.
