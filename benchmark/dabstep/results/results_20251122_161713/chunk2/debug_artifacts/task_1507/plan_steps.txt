Step 1: Load `payments.csv` and calculate the most frequent value (mode) for `merchant`, `is_credit`, `aci`, and the derived `intracountry` status (determined by comparing `issuing_country` and `acquirer_country`) to define the parameters of the "average scenario".
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the `merchant_category_code` and `account_type` for the merchant 'Crossfit_Hanna', and simultaneously load `payments.csv` to calculate the average monthly transaction volume (sum of `eur_amount` grouped by month) for this merchant to determine the correct `monthly_volume` tier.
Step 3: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`. Identify the "average scenario" by finding the most frequent `merchant`, `is_credit` status, `aci`, and `intracountry` status (where issuing country equals acquirer country) from `payments.csv`. For the identified most frequent merchant, calculate their average monthly volume and fraud rate from `payments.csv`, and retrieve their `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, and `capture_delay` from `merchant_data.json`. Finally, filter `fees.json` for rules matching these parameters for each card scheme, calculate the fee for a 50 EUR transaction, and identify the cheapest scheme.
