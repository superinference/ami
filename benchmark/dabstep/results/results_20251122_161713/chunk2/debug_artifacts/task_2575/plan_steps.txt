Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file and filter for the entry where `ID` is 787 to retrieve its current matching criteria (specifically `card_scheme`, `merchant_category_code`, `aci`, `is_credit`, and its current `account_type`).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` and `payments.csv`. Filter payments for `card_scheme` == 'NexPay', `is_credit` == False, and `aci` in ['A', 'C']. Get unique merchants from this filtered set. Join with `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the `account_type` for these merchants. Finally, identify and list merchants that have `account_type` equal to 'D' (fee no longer applies) or 'S' (fee now applies).
