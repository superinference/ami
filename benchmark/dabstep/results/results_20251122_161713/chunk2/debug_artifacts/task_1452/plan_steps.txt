Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file into a pandas DataFrame to access the fee rules, as the question asks for a theoretical fee calculation based on specific transaction characteristics (NexPay, credit, 100 euros).
Step 2: Filter the `fees` DataFrame to include only rows where `card_scheme` is 'NexPay' and `is_credit` is either `True` or `None`, calculate the fee for a 100 euro transaction using the formula `fixed_amount + (rate * 100 / 10000)`, expand the `aci` list (treating empty lists as applying to all ACIs: A, B, C, D, E, F, G), find the maximum fee for each ACI, and identify the ACI with the highest fee (using alphabetical order for ties).
