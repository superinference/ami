Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions for the merchant 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' that occurred in December (where `day_of_year` is greater than or equal to 335).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` and `fees.json`, extract the merchant profile for 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso', calculate the merchant's December `monthly_volume` and `monthly_fraud_level` from the filtered payments data, and add an `intracountry` column (True if `issuing_country` equals `acquirer_country`) to the dataframe to prepare for fee calculation.
Step 3: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`. Filter for 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' transactions in December (day_of_year >= 335). Calculate the merchant's December total volume and fraud rate. Then, for each card scheme, calculate the total fees by applying the matching rules from `fees.json` (based on merchant profile, volume/fraud tiers, and transaction details) to the filtered transactions, and identify the scheme with the highest total fees.
