Step 1: Load `payments.csv` and calculate the most frequent values (mode) for `merchant`, `is_credit`, `aci`, and the `intracountry` status (derived from comparing `issuing_country` and `acquirer_country`) to define the characteristics of the "average scenario" transaction.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, and `capture_delay` for "Crossfit_Hanna", then load `payments.csv` to calculate the merchant's average monthly volume and fraud rate, and finally use these parameters along with the previously identified average transaction characteristics (Credit=True, ACI='D', Intracountry=False) to filter `fees.json`, calculate the fee for a 100 EUR transaction for each card scheme, and identify the cheapest one.
Step 3: Compare the calculated fees for the identified average scenario (TransactPlus: 0.49 EUR, SwiftCharge: 0.59 EUR, GlobalCard: 0.85 EUR) and identify the card scheme with the lowest fee to answer the question.
