Step 1: Load the "fees.json" file into a dataframe and filter for rows where the 'card_scheme' is 'NexPay' and the 'account_type' column either contains 'S' or is empty (indicating a wildcard).
Step 2: Calculate the fee for each row in the filtered dataset (where card_scheme is 'NexPay' and account_type includes 'S' or is empty) using the formula `fee = fixed_amount + (rate * 1234 / 10000)`, then compute the average of these fees and output the result rounded to 6 decimal places.
