Step 1: To answer the question about applicable Fee IDs for "Golfclub_Baron_Friso" on the 200th day of 2023, I need to calculate the merchant's monthly stats (volume and fraud) for July (since day 200 falls in July), retrieve the merchant's static attributes, identify the transaction characteristics present on that specific day, and then cross-reference all this information with the rules in `fees.json`.

Here is the plan:

import json

# 1. Load Data
payments = pd.read_csv('payments.csv')
with open('merchant_data.json', 'r') as f:
    merchant_data = json.load(f)
with open('fees.json', 'r') as f:
    fees_data = json.load(f)

# 2. Define Context
target_merchant = 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso'
target_day = 200
# Day 200 in 2023 is in July (Jan=31+Feb=28+Mar=31+Apr=30+May=31+Jun=30 = 181 days).
# July is days 182 to 212.
july_start = 182
july_end = 212

# 3. Calculate Monthly Stats (July) for Merchant
july_txns = payments[(payments['merchant'] == target_merchant) & 
                     (payments['day_of_
