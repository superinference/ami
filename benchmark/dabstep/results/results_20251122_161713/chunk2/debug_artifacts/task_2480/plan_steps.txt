Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file into a dataframe and filter the data to include only transactions where the `merchant` is 'Belles_cookbook_store' and the `year` is 2023.
Step 2: Load `fees.json` and `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the details for fee ID 150 (specifically its matching criteria and current rate) and the merchant attributes for 'Belles_cookbook_store' (MCC, account type, etc.). Then, filter the previously loaded 2023 transactions for 'Belles_cookbook_store' to identify those that match the criteria of fee ID 150 (matching `card_scheme`, `is_credit`, `aci`, `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, and `intracountry` status). Finally, calculate the total `eur_amount` for these matching transactions and compute the fee delta using the formula: `(99 - old_rate) * total_volume / 10000`.
