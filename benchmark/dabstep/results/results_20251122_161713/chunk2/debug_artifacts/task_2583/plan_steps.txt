Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions for the merchant 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' where the `day_of_year` is between 1 and 31 (representing January).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the `account_type`, `merchant_category_code`, and `capture_delay` for "Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse", and simultaneously calculate the total `eur_amount` (monthly volume) and the fraud rate (total `eur_amount` of transactions with `has_fraudulent_dispute` divided by total volume) for the January transactions already filtered.
Step 3: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`. Filter for 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' transactions in January to calculate the merchant's total monthly volume and fraud rate. Then, for each card scheme (NexPay, GlobalCard, SwiftCharge, TransactPlus), apply the fee rules from `fees.json` to the January transactions (matching on attributes like `is_credit`, `aci`, `intracountry`, and the calculated monthly metrics) to determine which scheme results in the highest total fees.
