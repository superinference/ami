Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file and filter for the entry where `ID` is equal to 17 to extract the specific criteria (such as card scheme, merchant category codes, ACI, etc.) required to match this fee.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to identify merchants with a `capture_delay` greater than 5 days (interpreting numeric strings like "7" as > 5), then load `payments.csv` to filter for transactions in 2023 that match the fee's transaction-level criteria (`card_scheme`='SwiftCharge', `is_credit`=True, `aci`='A') and belong to those identified merchants, finally listing the unique merchant names.
