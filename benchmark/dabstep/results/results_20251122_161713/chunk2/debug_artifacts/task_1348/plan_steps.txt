Step 1: Load "merchant_category_codes.csv" into a dataframe and filter the rows where the `description` column exactly matches "Drinking Places (Alcoholic Beverages) - Bars, Taverns, Nightclubs, Cocktail Lounges, and Discotheques" to extract the corresponding `mcc` value.
Step 2: Load "fees.json" into a dataframe, filter for rows where `card_scheme` is 'TransactPlus', `account_type` contains 'H' (or is empty/null), and `merchant_category_code` contains 5813 (or is empty/null), then calculate the fee for each matching rule using `fee = fixed_amount + (rate * 100 / 10000)` and finally compute the average of these fees.
