Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions where the `merchant` is 'Rafa_AI' and the `day_of_year` is between 60 and 90 (inclusive), representing March 2023.
Step 2: Load the `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, `fees.json`, and `acquirer_countries.csv` files. Filter transactions for 'Rafa_AI' in March 2023 (day_of_year 60-90). Calculate the total monthly volume and fraud rate for this merchant in March. Then, iterate through each transaction to calculate the fee by matching it against the rules in `fees.json`, ensuring to correctly parse and match ranges for `monthly_volume`, `monthly_fraud_level`, and `capture_delay` (mapping '7' to '>5'), and handling the `intracountry` logic based on `issuing_country` and `acquirer_country`. Finally, sum the calculated fees.
