Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file and filter the data to retrieve the specific fee rule with `ID` equal to 787, in order to identify its current matching criteria (such as `card_scheme`, `merchant_category_code`, and existing `account_type` configuration).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to identify merchants with `account_type` 'R', then load `payments.csv` and filter for transactions belonging to these merchants that also match the fee's criteria (`card_scheme`='NexPay', `is_credit`=False, `aci` in ['C', 'A']), and finally list the unique merchants from the resulting transactions.
