Step 1: Load "merchant_category_codes.csv" into a dataframe and filter the rows where the "description" column exactly matches "Taxicabs and Limousines" to retrieve the corresponding merchant category code (mcc).
Step 2: Load "fees.json" into a dataframe, filter for rows where 'card_scheme' is 'GlobalCard', 'account_type' contains 'H' (or is empty), and 'merchant_category_code' contains 4121 (or is empty), then calculate the fee for a 10 EUR transaction (fixed_amount + rate * 10 / 10000) for each matching rule and compute the average.
