Step 1: Load the `payments.csv`, `fees.json`, and `merchant_data.json` files into pandas DataFrames to access the transaction data, fee structures, and merchant attributes.
Step 2: Filter the payments DataFrame to select transactions for merchant 'Crossfit_Hanna' with 'GlobalCard' scheme and 'is_credit' as True, sum the 'eur_amount' for these transactions, and calculate the payment delta using the rate difference (99 - 83) divided by 10000.
