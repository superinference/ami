Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file into a dataframe and filter the rows to include only transactions where the `merchant` column is 'Belles_cookbook_store' and the `year` column is 2023.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` and `fees.json` to extract the current `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, and `capture_delay` for 'Belles_cookbook_store', then add an `intracountry` column to the filtered payments dataframe and calculate the merchant's monthly total volume and monthly fraud rate (based on `eur_amount` and `has_fraudulent_dispute`) to prepare for fee rule matching.
Step 3: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`, filter for 'Belles_cookbook_store' transactions in 2023, then calculate the total fees for the year using the merchant's original MCC and the hypothetical MCC 7523 by matching each transaction to the correct fee rule (considering card scheme, account type, capture delay, monthly volume/fraud stats, ACI, is_credit, and intracountry status), and finally compute the difference between the two totals.
