Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the dataset to include only transactions where the `merchant` is 'Belles_cookbook_store' and the `day_of_year` is between 1 and 31 (representing January).
Step 2: Calculate the total monthly volume and fraud rate for 'Belles_cookbook_store' in January from the filtered payments data, then load 'merchant_data.json' to get the merchant's category code and account type, and 'fees.json' to access the fee structures.
