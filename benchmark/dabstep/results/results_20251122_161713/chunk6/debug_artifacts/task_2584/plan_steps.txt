Step 1: Load `payments.csv` and filter for transactions belonging to 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' where the `day_of_year` is between 1 and 31 (representing January), then calculate the average `eur_amount` and the proportion of credit vs. debit transactions (`is_credit`) to establish the transaction profile.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the account type, merchant category code, and capture delay for 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse', then calculate the merchant's total volume and fraud rate for January from `payments.csv`, and finally use these attributes to filter `fees.json` and calculate the weighted average fee per transaction for each card scheme to identify the cheapest one.
