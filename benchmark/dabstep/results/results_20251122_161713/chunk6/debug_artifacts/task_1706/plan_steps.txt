Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions where the `merchant` is "Rafa_AI", the `year` is 2023, and the `day_of_year` is 12.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the account type, category code, and capture delay for "Rafa_AI", calculate the merchant's total volume and fraud rate for January 2023 using `payments.csv`, and then iterate through `fees.json` to identify all Fee IDs that match the merchant's profile and the unique transaction attributes (card scheme, credit status, ACI, and intracountry status) found for "Rafa_AI" on day 12.
