Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file into a dataframe and filter for rows where the `merchant` column is 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' and the `year` is 2023 to isolate the relevant transactions.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the account type, capture delay, and current MCC for 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse', load `fees.json`, and then process the filtered payments dataframe to add an 'intracountry' column (True if issuing_country equals acquirer_country) and calculate monthly total volumes and fraud rates (ratio of fraudulent volume to total volume) to prepare for fee application.
