Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` dataframe and filter for rows where the `merchant` column is 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' and the `year` column is 2023.
Step 2: Retrieve the merchant's metadata (MCC, account type, capture delay) from `merchant_data.json`, calculate the average monthly volume and fraud rate from the filtered transactions, determine the unique combinations of transaction attributes (card scheme, is_credit, aci, intracountry status), and filter the `fees.json` list to identify all fee IDs that match these criteria.
Step 3: Based on the analysis of the `payments.csv` and `merchant_data.json` files, and applying the fee rules from `fees.json` considering the merchant's metadata (MCC 7993, Account Type F, Capture Delay 2) and transaction characteristics in 2023, the applicable fee IDs have been identified.

The applicable fee IDs for Golfclub_Baron_Friso in 2023 are: 36, 51, 53, 64, 65, 107, 123, 150, 163, 276, 304, 381, 384, 394, 398, 428, 454, 473, 477, 536, 572, 595, 608, 626, 631, 678, 680, 709, 725, 741, 813, 861, 868, 871, 884, 939, 942, 960.
