Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the dataframe to include only rows where the `merchant` column is 'Rafa_AI' and the `day_of_year` column is between 274 and 304 (representing the month of October).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` and `fees.json` to retrieve the merchant's attributes (MCC, account type, capture delay) and fee rules. Using the filtered October data, calculate the total transaction volume and fraud rate (fraudulent volume divided by total volume) to determine the applicable volume and fraud buckets, and add an `intracountry` column (True if `issuing_country` equals `acquirer_country`, else False).
