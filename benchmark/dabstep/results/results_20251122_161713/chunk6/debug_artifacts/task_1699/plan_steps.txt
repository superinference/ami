Step 1: Load `payments.csv` and filter for rows where `merchant` is "Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse", `year` is 2023, and `day_of_year` is 10 to identify the unique transaction characteristics (such as `card_scheme`, `is_credit`, `aci`, `issuing_country`, and `acquirer_country`) present on that specific date.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to get the merchant's attributes (account type, MCC, capture delay), load `payments.csv` to calculate the merchant's monthly volume and fraud level for January 2023 and identify unique transaction profiles for day 10, then load `fees.json` to find all Fee IDs that match the merchant's attributes and the transaction profiles present on that day.
