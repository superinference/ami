Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the dataframe to include only rows where the `merchant` column is 'Crossfit_Hanna' and the date corresponds to November 2023 (specifically, where `year` is 2023 and `day_of_year` is between 305 and 334).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the `account_type`, `merchant_category_code`, and `capture_delay` for 'Crossfit_Hanna'. Then, using the filtered payments data, calculate the total monthly volume and fraud rate (fraud volume / total volume) for November 2023, and identify unique combinations of `card_scheme`, `is_credit`, `aci`, and `intracountry` (where `issuing_country` == `acquirer_country`). Finally, load `fees.json` and filter for rules that match both the merchant's aggregate/static data and the transaction-level characteristics to list the applicable Fee IDs.
