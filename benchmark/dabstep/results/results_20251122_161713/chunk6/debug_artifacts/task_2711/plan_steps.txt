Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter for transactions where the `merchant` is 'Rafa_AI', `has_fraudulent_dispute` is True, and `day_of_year` is between 60 and 90 (inclusive) to isolate the relevant fraudulent transactions for March.
Step 2: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`. Filter payments for 'Rafa_AI' in March (day_of_year 60-90). Calculate the merchant's monthly volume and fraud rate for March to determine the applicable fee tier. Then, for the fraudulent transactions in that period, calculate the total fees if they were processed under each possible ACI (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) and identify the ACI that results in the lowest total cost.
