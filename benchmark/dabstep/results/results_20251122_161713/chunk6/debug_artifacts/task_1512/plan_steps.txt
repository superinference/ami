Step 1: Load `payments.csv` and calculate the most frequent value (mode) for `aci`, `is_credit`, and the boolean status of `intracountry` (determined by comparing `issuing_country` and `acquirer_country`) to define the parameters for the "average scenario".
Step 2: Load `payments.csv` and `merchant_data.json` to identify the most frequent merchant, then calculate their average monthly volume and fraud rate, and retrieve their `account_type`, `merchant_category_code`, and `capture_delay`. Finally, load `fees.json`, filter for rules matching these merchant parameters and the previously determined average scenario parameters (ACI='D', is_credit=True, intracountry=False), calculate the fee for a 500 EUR transaction for each card scheme, and identify the most expensive one.
