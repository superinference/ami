Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file into a dataframe and filter for rows where `card_scheme` is 'NexPay' and `is_credit` is True.
Step 2: Based on the previous result of `2.49723450479233`, which appears to be the calculated weighted average fee in EUR for the specified transactions, the next step is to format and present this result.

Output the calculated average fee of 2.50 EUR for NexPay credit transactions with a value of 500 EUR.
