Step 1: Load `payments.csv` and filter for transactions where the merchant is 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' and the year is 2023 to establish the transaction profile (traffic) that needs to be evaluated.
Step 2: Load `fees.json` and `payments.csv`, filter for 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' in 2023, then calculate the total fees for each card scheme (NexPay, GlobalCard, SwiftCharge, TransactPlus) by applying the fee rules based on the merchant's monthly volume and fraud rate (calculated per month), and the transaction characteristics (amount, credit status, ACI, and intracountry status), to identify the scheme resulting in the maximum fees.
