Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter for transactions where the merchant is 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse', the month is March (day_of_year between 60 and 90), and `has_fraudulent_dispute` is True.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the account type and merchant category code for 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse', load `fees.json` to understand the fee structures, and then process `payments.csv` to calculate the merchant's total volume and fraud level for March (to satisfy fee rule conditions) and compute the total projected fees for the identified fraudulent transactions under each alternative Authorization Characteristics Indicator (A, B, C, D, E, F) to find the lowest cost option.
