Step 1: Load the `merchant_category_codes.csv` file into a dataframe and filter it to find the `mcc` value where the `description` column exactly matches "Drinking Places (Alcoholic Beverages) - Bars, Taverns, Nightclubs, Cocktail Lounges, and Discotheques".
Step 2: Load the `fees.json` file into a dataframe, filter for rows where `card_scheme` is 'TransactPlus', `account_type` is either empty or contains 'H', and `merchant_category_code` is either empty or contains 5813; then calculate the fee for each matching rule using the formula `fee = fixed_amount + (rate * 50 / 10000)` and compute the average of these fees.
