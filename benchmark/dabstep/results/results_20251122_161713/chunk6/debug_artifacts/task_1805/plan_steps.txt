Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions where the `merchant` is "Rafa_AI", the `year` is 2023, and the `day_of_year` falls within the range for July (days 182 to 212).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve Rafa_AI's attributes (MCC, account type, capture delay), load `fees.json`, and using the previously calculated July 2023 stats (Volume: 212,217.24, Fraud Rate: 9.90%) and the filtered transaction data, determine which Fee IDs are applicable by matching both merchant-level rules and transaction-level characteristics (card scheme, ACI, is_credit, intracountry status).
