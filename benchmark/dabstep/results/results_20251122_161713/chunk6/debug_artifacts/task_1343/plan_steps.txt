Step 1: To answer this question, I will first search the `merchant_category_codes.csv` file to find the specific Merchant Category Code (MCC) integer that corresponds to the description "Drinking Places (Alcoholic Beverages) - Bars, Taverns, Nightclubs, Cocktail Lounges, and Discotheques".
Step 2: Load "fees.json" and filter for rules where `card_scheme` is 'SwiftCharge', `account_type` contains 'H' (or is empty), and `merchant_category_code` contains 5813 (or is empty). Then, for each matching rule, calculate the fee using the formula `fee = fixed_amount + (rate * 50 / 10000)`, compute the average of these fees, and round to 6 decimal places.
