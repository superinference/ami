Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions where the `merchant` is 'Belles_cookbook_store' and the date corresponds to July 2023 (using the `year` and `day_of_year` columns, noting that July 2023 spans days 182 to 212).
Step 2: Load the `filtered_transactions.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json` files. Calculate the total monthly volume and fraud rate for 'Belles_cookbook_store' in July 2023 from the transactions. Then, using the merchant's static attributes (from `merchant_data.json`) and the calculated monthly metrics, iterate through the unique transaction characteristics (card scheme, credit status, ACI, intracountry status) in the filtered data to identify all Fee IDs from `fees.json` that apply to at least one transaction.
