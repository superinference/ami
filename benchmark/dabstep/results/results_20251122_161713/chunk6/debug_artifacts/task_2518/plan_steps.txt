Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` dataframe filtering for transactions where the merchant is "Rafa_AI" and the year is 2023, and load the `fees.json` file to retrieve the matching criteria and original rate for the fee with ID=787.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to determine the account type of "Rafa_AI". Then, filter the "Rafa_AI" transactions from `payments.csv` where `card_scheme` is 'NexPay', `is_credit` is False, and `aci` is either 'C' or 'A'. Finally, calculate the total transaction volume for these filtered payments and compute the fee delta using the formula `(99 - 38) * volume / 10000`.
