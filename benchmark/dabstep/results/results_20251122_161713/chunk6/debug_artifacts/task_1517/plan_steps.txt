Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` dataset and determine the most frequent values for `is_credit`, `aci`, and `merchant`, as well as the most common `intracountry` status (derived from comparing `issuing_country` and `acquirer_country`), to define the "average scenario" parameters.
Step 2: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`, calculate the monthly volume and fraud rate for the merchant 'Crossfit_Hanna', retrieve its `account_type` and `capture_delay`, then filter the fee rules based on the "average scenario" parameters (is_credit=True, aci='D', intracountry=False, mcc=7997) plus the merchant-specific metrics to calculate and compare the transaction fees for 1234 EUR across all card schemes.
