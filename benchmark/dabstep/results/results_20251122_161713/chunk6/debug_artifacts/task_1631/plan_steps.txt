Step 1: Load the "fees.json" file into a dataframe to inspect the fee structures and rules.
Step 2: To answer the question about the average fee for account type F and card scheme SwiftCharge for a 500 EUR transaction, I need to process the `fees.json` file. I will filter the fee rules to find those applicable to 'SwiftCharge' and account type 'F' (including rules that apply to all account types). Then, I will calculate the fee for each applicable rule using the formula provided in the manual (`fee = fixed_amount + rate * transaction_value / 10000`) with a transaction value of 500 EUR, and finally compute the average of these fees.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the fees data
fees_df = pd.read_json('fees.json')

# Filter for 'SwiftCharge' card scheme
swift_fees = fees_df[fees_df['card_scheme'] == 'SwiftCharge']

# Filter for Account Type 'F'
# The rule applies if 'account_type' list contains 'F' OR if the list is empty (wildcard)
def is_applicable_account(acc_type_list):
    if not acc_type_list: # Empty list or None implies it applies to all
        return True
    return 'F' in acc_type_list

applicable_fees = swift_fees[
Step 3: To answer the question accurately, I need to calculate the fee based on the specific characteristics of the merchants that belong to Account Type 'F'. The fee rules in `fees.json` depend on merchant-specific attributes like `monthly_volume`, `monthly_fraud_level`, `merchant_category_code`, and `capture_delay`. I will identify the Account F merchants, calculate their volume and fraud metrics from `payments.csv`, and then filter the `fees.json` rules to find the ones that specifically apply to these merchants' profiles for the 'SwiftCharge' scheme. Finally, I will calculate the average fee for a 500 EUR transaction based on these applicable rules.

Here is the plan:
1.  **Identify Account F Merchants & Calculate Stats**: Load `merchant_data.json` to find merchants with `account_type` 'F'. Then, using `payments.csv`, calculate the `monthly_volume` (Total Volume / 12) and `monthly_fraud_level` (Fraud Volume / Total Volume) for each of these merchants. Also, retrieve their `merchant_category_code` and `capture_delay`.
