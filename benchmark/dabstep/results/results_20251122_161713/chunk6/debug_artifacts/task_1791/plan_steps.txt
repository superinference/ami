Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file into a dataframe and filter for rows where the `merchant` is 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' and the `day_of_year` is between 121 and 151 (representing May 2023).
Step 2: Load `fees.json`, `merchant_data.json`, and `payments.csv`. Filter `payments.csv` for 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' transactions in May 2023 (day_of_year 121-151). Calculate the merchant's monthly volume and fraud rate for this period. Identify the unique combinations of transaction attributes (`card_scheme`, `is_credit`, `aci`, and `intracountry` status) present in the filtered data. Finally, iterate through `fees.json` to identify and list all Fee IDs where the rule's criteria (matching the merchant's calculated volume, fraud rate, MCC, account type, capture delay) and transaction attributes match the merchant's profile and at least one of their transaction types.
