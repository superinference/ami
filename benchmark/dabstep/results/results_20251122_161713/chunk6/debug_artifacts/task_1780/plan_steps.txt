Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` dataset and filter for transactions where the `merchant` is 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' and the `day_of_year` is between 152 and 181 (representing June 2023).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, and `capture_delay` for 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso'. Then, using the filtered payments data, calculate the total `eur_amount` (monthly volume) and the fraud rate (fraudulent volume / total volume) for June 2023, and identify unique combinations of `card_scheme`, `is_credit`, `aci`, and `intracountry` status (True if `issuing_country` == `acquirer_country`). Finally, load `fees.json` and filter for Fee IDs that match the merchant's static attributes, the calculated monthly stats, and the observed transaction characteristics.
