Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file into a dataframe to inspect the fee rules and their conditions.
Step 2: To answer the question about the average fee for Account Type F and GlobalCard with a transaction value of 4321 EUR, I need to simulate the fee calculation for relevant historical transactions.

The fee depends on merchant attributes (Account Type, MCC, Capture Delay, Monthly Volume, Monthly Fraud Level) and transaction attributes (Card Scheme, ACI, Is Credit, Intracountry).

I will perform the following steps in a Python script:
1.  **Load Data**: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`.
2.  **Identify Merchants**: Filter `merchant_data` to find merchants with `account_type == 'F'`.
3.  **Calculate Monthly Stats**: Using the full `payments` dataset for these merchants, calculate the `monthly_volume` (sum of `eur_amount`) and `monthly_fraud_level` (sum of `eur_amount` where `has_fraudulent_dispute` is True / total volume) for each month.
4.  **Filter Transactions**: Filter `payments` for the identified merchants and `card_scheme == 'GlobalCard'`.
5.  **Enrich Transactions**: Add `intracountry` (issuing ==
