Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions for the merchant 'Belles_cookbook_store' that occurred in April (where `day_of_year` is between 91 and 120).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the merchant's profile (MCC, account type, capture delay) and `fees.json` for the fee rules, then reload the April transactions for 'Belles_cookbook_store' to calculate and compare the total projected fees for each card scheme based on the transaction characteristics (amount, credit status, ACI, and domestic/international status).
