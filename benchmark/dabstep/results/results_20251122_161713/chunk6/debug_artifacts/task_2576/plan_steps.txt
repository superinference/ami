Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file and filter for the entry where the `ID` is 787 to identify the specific criteria (such as card scheme, merchant category codes, and current account types) associated with this fee rule.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to create a dictionary mapping each merchant to their `account_type`, then load `payments.csv` and filter for transactions in 2023 that match Fee 787's criteria (`card_scheme` == 'NexPay', `is_credit` == False, and `aci` in ['C', 'A']), and finally identify which of these merchants have an account type of 'D' or 'O'.
Step 3: Load `fees.json` to extract the criteria for Fee ID 787 (specifically `card_scheme`, `merchant_category_code`, `is_credit`, `aci`, etc., ignoring the original `account_type`). Then, load `merchant_data.json` to identify which merchants have `account_type` equal to 'O'. Finally, load `payments.csv`, filter for transactions in 2023 that match the Fee 787 criteria and involve the identified 'O' type merchants, and return the unique names of these merchants.
