Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` dataframe and filter for rows where `merchant` is 'Rafa_AI' and the `day_of_year` is between 213 and 243 (representing August 2023).
Step 2: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`. Filter payments for 'Rafa_AI' in August 2023 (days 213-243). Calculate the monthly volume and fraud rate for this merchant in August. Then, for each transaction, identify the applicable fee rule from `fees.json` by matching all criteria (card scheme, account type, merchant category code, ACI, is_credit, intracountry status, capture delay, monthly volume, and fraud level), handling wildcards and range parsing correctly. Finally, calculate the fee for each transaction using the formula `fee = fixed_amount + (rate * amount / 10000)` and sum them up to get the total fees.
