Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter for all transactions where the merchant is "Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse" and the month is April (4), in order to subsequently calculate the merchant's monthly volume and fraud rate, and to isolate the fraudulent transactions (`has_fraudulent_dispute` = True) for the ACI simulation.
Step 2: Load the `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json` files, filter for 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' transactions in April to calculate the merchant's monthly volume and fraud rate, isolate the fraudulent transactions, and then calculate the total projected fees for these specific transactions under each possible Authorization Characteristics Indicator (ACI) (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) to identify the ACI that yields the lowest total fee.
