Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions for the merchant "Rafa_AI" that occurred in June 2023 (day_of_year 152 to 181).
Step 2: Load `fees.json` to find the original rate and matching criteria for fee ID=141, and `merchant_data.json` to retrieve Rafa_AI's `merchant_category_code` and `account_type`. Then, filter the June 2023 transactions to identify those that match Fee 141's criteria (checking card_scheme, is_credit, aci, intracountry status, and merchant attributes), sum their `eur_amount`, and calculate the delta using the formula `(99 - original_rate) * total_matching_amount / 10000`.
