Step 1: Filter the `payments.csv` dataset to include only transactions where the `merchant` is "Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse", the `year` is 2023, and the `day_of_year` is 100.
Step 2: Calculate the total monthly volume and fraud volume for "Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse" in April 2023 (days 91-120) to determine the applicable `monthly_volume` and `monthly_fraud_level` tiers, and simultaneously retrieve the merchant's `account_type`, `merchant_category_code`, and `capture_delay` from `merchant_data.json`.
Step 3: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`, then for 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse', calculate the monthly volume and fraud rate for April 2023 (days 91-120), filter transactions for day 100, and iterate through them to calculate the total fees by finding the matching rule in `fees.json` based on transaction details (card scheme, credit status, ACI, intracountry status) and merchant/monthly stats (account type, MCC, capture delay, monthly volume, fraud level).
