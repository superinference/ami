Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter for rows where the `merchant` is 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso', the `year` is 2023, and the `day_of_year` is 12 to identify the relevant transactions and their characteristics (such as card scheme, ACI, and credit status).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to get the `capture_delay` for 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso', load `payments.csv` for the entire month of January (days 1-31) to calculate the merchant's `monthly_volume` and `monthly_fraud_level`, and then load `fees.json` to determine which Fee IDs apply to the transactions from day 12 based on the matching criteria (merchant attributes, monthly stats, and transaction characteristics).
