Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter for rows where `merchant` is 'Crossfit_Hanna', `has_fraudulent_dispute` is True, and `day_of_year` corresponds to July (182 to 212).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve account details for 'Crossfit_Hanna', calculate the merchant's total transaction volume and fraud rate for July from `payments.csv` to determine the applicable fee tiers, and then using `fees.json`, calculate the total fees for the 364 fraudulent transactions under each possible Authorization Characteristics Indicator (ACI) to identify the option with the lowest cost.
