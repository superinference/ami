Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions for the merchant 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' in the year 2023.
Step 2: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`. Filter the payments for 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' in 2023. Calculate the monthly transaction volume and fraud rates for this merchant. Retrieve the merchant's original MCC, account_type, and capture_delay from `merchant_data.json`. Then, calculate the total fees for the year under two scenarios: 1) using the original MCC, and 2) using MCC 5411. For each transaction, match the appropriate fee rule from `fees.json` based on the transaction details (card_scheme, is_credit, aci, intracountry), merchant details (account_type, capture_delay), and calculated monthly stats (volume, fraud level). Finally, compute the difference (Scenario 2 Fees - Scenario 1 Fees).
