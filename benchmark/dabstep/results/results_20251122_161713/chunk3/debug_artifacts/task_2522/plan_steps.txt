Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file and extract the specific criteria (such as card scheme, merchant category code, account type, etc.) defined for the fee with ID 10.
Step 2: Load `fees.json`, `merchant_data.json`, and `payments.csv`. Filter `merchant_data.json` for merchants matching Fee ID 10's `merchant_category_code` and `capture_delay`. Then, for those merchants, calculate their monthly volumes from `payments.csv` to check against Fee ID 10's `monthly_volume` requirement, and finally filter for transactions in 2023 matching `card_scheme`, `aci`, and `intracountry` criteria to identify the affected merchants.
