Step 1: Load `payments.csv` and filter for rows where `merchant` is 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso', the month is May (approx. days 121-151), and `has_fraudulent_dispute` is True; simultaneously load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the merchant's `merchant_category_code` and `account_type` required for fee calculations.
Step 2: Load `fees.json` and calculate the total transaction fees for the filtered fraudulent transactions for each possible Authorization Characteristics Indicator (ACI) ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'], assuming all other transaction details (amount, card scheme, etc.) remain constant, to identify the ACI that results in the lowest total fees.
