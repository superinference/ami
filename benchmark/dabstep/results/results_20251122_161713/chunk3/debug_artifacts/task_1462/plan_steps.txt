Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file into a dataframe to inspect the fee rules and their characteristics.
Step 2: To answer the question about the most expensive Authorization Characteristics Indicator (ACI) for a credit transaction of 10000 euros on TransactPlus, I need to calculate the maximum potential fee for each ACI based on the rules in `fees.json`.

I will perform the following steps:
1.  Load the `fees.json` dataset.
2.  Filter the fee rules to include only those where `card_scheme` is 'TransactPlus' and `is_credit` is either `True` or `null` (wildcard).
3.  Iterate through each possible ACI (A, B, C, D, E, F, G).
4.  For each ACI, identify the rules that apply (where the rule's `aci` field contains the specific ACI or is `null`).
5.  Calculate the fee for each applicable rule using the formula: `fee = fixed_amount + rate * (10000 / 10000)`.
6.  Determine the maximum fee for each ACI.
7.  Identify the ACI(s) with the highest maximum fee, sorting alphabetically to resolve ties, and return the result as a list.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the fees data
fees_df = pd.read_json('fees.json')

# Filter for TransactPlus and Credit transactions (including wildcards for is_credit)
