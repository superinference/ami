Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file into a dataframe and filter it to include only rows where the `merchant` is "Crossfit_Hanna", the `year` is 2023, and the `day_of_year` is 12.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the merchant's attributes (MCC, account type, capture delay), load `fees.json`, and calculate the total monthly volume and fraud rate for 'Crossfit_Hanna' in January 2023 using `payments.csv`, then use these values and the transaction details from January 12th to identify all applicable Fee IDs.
