Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter for transactions where the merchant is 'Rafa_AI', the `day_of_year` is between 305 and 334 (representing November), and `has_fraudulent_dispute` is True.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the `merchant_category_code` and `account_type` for 'Rafa_AI'. Then, load `payments.csv` to calculate the total transaction volume and fraud rate for 'Rafa_AI' in November (days 305-334). Finally, load `fees.json` to prepare for fee calculation.
Step 3: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`. Filter `payments.csv` for 'Rafa_AI' transactions in November (day_of_year 305-334). Calculate the total monthly volume and fraud rate (fraud volume / total volume) for this merchant in November. Identify the subset of fraudulent transactions. Then, for each possible Authorization Characteristics Indicator (ACI) ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'], calculate the total fees for these fraudulent transactions by finding the applicable rule in `fees.json` (matching merchant stats, transaction details, and the hypothetical ACI) and summing the costs. Finally, identify the ACI with the lowest total fees.
