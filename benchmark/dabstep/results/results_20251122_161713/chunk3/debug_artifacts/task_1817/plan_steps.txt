Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file into a dataframe and filter for transactions where the `merchant` is 'Belles_cookbook_store' and the `day_of_year` is between 182 and 212 (representing July in a non-leap year like 2023).
Step 2: Load the `payments.csv`, `fees.json`, and `merchant_data.json` files, calculate the monthly volume and fraud rate for 'Belles_cookbook_store' in July 2023 to determine the applicable fee tiers, then iterate through each transaction to find the matching fee rule based on all criteria (card scheme, credit status, ACI, intracountry, account type, MCC, etc.) and sum the calculated fees.
