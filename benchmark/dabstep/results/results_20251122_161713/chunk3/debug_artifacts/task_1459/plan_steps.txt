Step 1: Load the `fees.json` file into a pandas DataFrame to inspect the fee rules, specifically filtering for those applicable to 'GlobalCard' and credit transactions.
Step 2: To answer the question about the most expensive Authorization Characteristics Indicator (ACI) for a credit transaction of 10,000 euros on GlobalCard, I need to calculate the potential fees for each ACI based on the rules in `fees.json`.

I will perform the following steps:
1.  Load the `fees.json` dataset.
2.  Filter for rules applicable to 'GlobalCard' and Credit transactions (where `is_credit` is True or Null/Wildcard).
3.  Calculate the fee for a 10,000 euro transaction for each rule using the formula: `fee = fixed_amount + (rate * amount / 10000)`. Since the amount is 10,000, this simplifies to `fee = fixed_amount + rate`.
4.  Expand the rules to individual ACIs. If a rule has a null or empty `aci` field, it applies to all ACIs (A, B, C, D, E, F, G).
5.  Group the calculated fees by ACI and find the maximum fee for each ACI.
6.  Sort the results by fee (descending) and then by ACI (alphabetical ascending) to handle ties.
7.  Return the top ACI as a list.
