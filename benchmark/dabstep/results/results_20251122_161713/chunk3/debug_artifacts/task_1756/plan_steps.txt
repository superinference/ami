Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions for the merchant 'Belles_cookbook_store' that occurred in June 2023 (Day of Year 152 to 181).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the attributes (merchant_category_code, account_type, capture_delay) for 'Belles_cookbook_store', and load `fees.json`. Then, using the filtered June 2023 transactions, calculate the total monthly volume and fraud rate, determine the `intracountry` status for each transaction (issuing_country == acquirer_country), and match these against the `fees.json` rules to identify all applicable Fee IDs.
