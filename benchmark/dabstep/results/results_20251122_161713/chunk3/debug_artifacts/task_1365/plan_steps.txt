Step 1: Load the `merchant_category_codes.csv` file and filter the dataframe to find the `mcc` value where the `description` column exactly matches "Drinking Places (Alcoholic Beverages) - Bars, Taverns, Nightclubs, Cocktail Lounges, and Discotheques".
Step 2: Load `merchant_category_codes.csv` to find the MCC for "Drinking Places (Alcoholic Beverages) - Bars, Taverns, Nightclubs, Cocktail Lounges, and Discotheques", then load `fees.json` and filter for rules where `card_scheme` is 'GlobalCard', `account_type` contains 'H' (or is empty), and `merchant_category_code` contains the found MCC (or is empty), then calculate the fee for each matching rule using the formula `fixed_amount + (rate * 4321 / 10000)` and compute the average of these fees.
