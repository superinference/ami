Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file into a pandas DataFrame and filter the data for transactions where the `merchant` is 'Belles_cookbook_store', the `card_scheme` is 'SwiftCharge', and the `day_of_year` is greater than or equal to 305 (representing November 1st onwards).
Step 2: Group the filtered data by 'issuing_country' and calculate the mean of the 'eur_amount' column.
