Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter for transactions where the merchant is 'Rafa_AI' and the year is 2023, specifically isolating those with `has_fraudulent_dispute = True` to identify their current `shopper_interaction` and `aci`.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to get the `merchant_category_code` and `account_type` for 'Rafa_AI', and from `payments.csv`, filter for 'Rafa_AI's fraudulent transactions in 2023 to calculate the average `eur_amount` and determine the `intracountry` status (whether `issuing_country` equals `acquirer_country`).
Step 3: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`. Filter `payments.csv` for 'Rafa_AI' in 2023 to calculate average monthly volume and fraud rates to determine fee tiers. Identify the fraudulent transactions and their attributes (`eur_amount`, `card_scheme`, `is_credit`, `issuing_country`, `acquirer_country`). Load merchant details (`account_type`, `merchant_category_code`). For each potential ACI (A, B, C, D, E, F, G), calculate the applicable fees for these transactions based on `fees.json` rules, and identify the ACI that results in the lowest total fees.
