Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only rows where `card_scheme` is 'GlobalCard' and `is_credit` is True.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` and `fees.json`, then calculate monthly volume and fraud metrics for each merchant using the full `payments.csv` dataset, merge these metrics and merchant details into the filtered GlobalCard credit transactions, and finally apply the fee rules to calculate the average fee for a 4321 EUR transaction.
Step 3: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`, compute monthly volume and fraud stats per merchant, then for every GlobalCard credit transaction, identify the applicable fee rule (matching attributes like ACI, intracountry, and merchant stats) to calculate the fee for a 4321 EUR amount, and finally compute the mean of these fees.
