Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter for transactions belonging to the merchant 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse' where the `day_of_year` is between 121 and 151 (representing May), then calculate the total monthly volume, total fraud volume, and average transaction amount.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the profile (MCC, account type, capture delay) for 'Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse', then load `fees.json` to find all fee rules matching this profile and the calculated May metrics (monthly volume '100k-1m', fraud level '>8.3%'), and finally calculate the fee for each card scheme using the average transaction amount (92.36) to identify the most expensive one.
