Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the dataframe to include only transactions for the merchant 'Rafa_AI' that occurred in February 2023 (where `year` is 2023 and `day_of_year` is between 32 and 59).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` and `fees.json`, then using the filtered payments for 'Rafa_AI', calculate the merchant's February monthly volume and fraud rate. Iterate through the transactions to identify which ones match the fee rule with ID=17 (based on card scheme, account type, MCC, ACI, etc.), and for those matches, calculate the total payment delta using the formula: `(99 - original_rate) * amount / 10000`.
