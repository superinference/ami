Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter for rows where the merchant is 'Belles_cookbook_store' and the year is 2023 to analyze the transaction volume, amounts, and other characteristics required for fee calculation.
Step 2: Load the `fees.json` and `merchant_data.json` files, then calculate the total fees Belles_cookbook_store would pay under each of the four card schemes (GlobalCard, NexPay, SwiftCharge, TransactPlus) by applying the fee rules to the merchant's 2023 transactions (using the calculated monthly volume of ~105k, fraud rate of 9.3%, and other merchant attributes), and identify the scheme with the minimum total fees.
