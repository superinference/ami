Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the data to include only transactions where the `merchant` is 'Rafa_AI' and the `day_of_year` is between 274 and 304 (representing October 2023).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the `merchant_category_code`, `account_type`, and `capture_delay` for 'Rafa_AI', calculate the fraud rate (fraud volume / total volume) for October 2023 using the filtered payments data to determine the `monthly_fraud_level` and `monthly_volume` buckets, and finally load `fees.json` to identify all Fee IDs that match these merchant attributes and the transaction characteristics (card_scheme, is_credit, aci, intracountry) found in the data.
Step 3: Load `merchant_data.json` to get the metadata (merchant_category_code, account_type, capture_delay) for 'Rafa_AI', then load `payments.csv` to filter for 'Rafa_AI' transactions in October 2023 (day_of_year 274-304) to calculate the total volume and fraud rate (fraud volume / total volume) and identify unique transaction combinations (card_scheme, is_credit, aci, intracountry), and finally load `fees.json` to find all Fee IDs where the merchant's static/monthly attributes and the transaction's specific attributes match the fee rules.
