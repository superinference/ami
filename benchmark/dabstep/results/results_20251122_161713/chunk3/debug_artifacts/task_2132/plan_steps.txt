Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter for transactions where the `merchant` is 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' and the `day_of_year` is between 60 and 90 (inclusive) to isolate the relevant data for March 2023.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to retrieve the metadata (account_type, merchant_category_code, etc.) for 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso', and load `fees.json` to identify the rule with ID=65 and other applicable fee rules.
Step 3: Load `fees.json` to identify the criteria and original rate for fee ID=65, `merchant_data.json` to get the merchant's category code and account type, and `payments.csv` to filter for 'Golfclub_Baron_Friso' transactions in March 2023 (day_of_year 60-90); then, filter these transactions to find those matching the fee rule's criteria (card_scheme, is_credit, aci, account_type, merchant_category_code, intracountry) and calculate the payment delta using the formula `(99 - original_rate) * total_matching_amount / 10000`.
