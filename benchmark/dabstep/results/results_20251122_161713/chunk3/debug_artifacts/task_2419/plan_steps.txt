Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the dataframe to include only transactions for the merchant 'Rafa_AI' that occurred in July 2023.
Step 2: Load the `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json` files, then identify the merchant attributes (MCC, account type) for 'Rafa_AI' and the fee rule details for ID=276 (criteria and original rate). Filter the payments for 'Rafa_AI' in July 2023 (day_of_year 182-212) that match the fee rule's criteria (card_scheme, is_credit, aci, etc.), and calculate the total delta using the formula `sum(eur_amount * (1 - original_rate) / 10000)`.
