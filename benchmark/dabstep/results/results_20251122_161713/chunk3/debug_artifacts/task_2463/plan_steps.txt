Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the dataframe to include only transactions where the merchant is 'Rafa_AI', the year is 2023, and the day_of_year is greater than or equal to 335 (representing December 1st onwards).
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` and `fees.json` to retrieve Rafa_AI's attributes and the fee rules, calculate the merchant's December 2023 monthly volume and fraud rate from the filtered data to satisfy rule conditions, and then compute the total fee delta by applying the fee logic to the transactions with the original fee ID 141 versus the modified fee ID 141 (rate = 1).
Step 3: Load `payments.csv`, `merchant_data.json`, and `fees.json`, filter for Rafa_AI's transactions in December 2023, identify the fee rule with ID=141 and its original rate, select the transactions that satisfy all conditions of fee ID 141, and calculate the total fee delta by summing `(1 - original_rate) * eur_amount / 10000` for those transactions.
