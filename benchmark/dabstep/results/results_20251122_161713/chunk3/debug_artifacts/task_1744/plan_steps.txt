Step 1: Load the `payments.csv` file and filter the dataset to include only transactions where the merchant is "Martinis_Fine_Steakhouse" and the year is 2023.
Step 2: Load `merchant_data.json` to get the merchant's attributes, then load `fees.json` and the filtered transaction data to calculate monthly volume and fraud rates, and finally iterate through the fee rules to identify all applicable fee IDs for the merchant's transactions in 2023.
